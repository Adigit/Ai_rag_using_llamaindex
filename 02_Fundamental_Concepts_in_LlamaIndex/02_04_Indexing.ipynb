The girls at the desks in the outer room--no\\r\\nbobbed locks in those days, but grotesque oddities of coiffure drooping\\r\\nlow over foreheads and strangely puffed out over ears--stood up so\\r\\nunanimously, so instantly, that it was plain they had been waiting for\\r\\nthe hands of the clock to mark the hour of liberation. The fugue of\\r\\ntypewriters stopped; voices and the shuffling of feet sounded another\\r\\nrhythm. A stenographer closed a door behind her, came forward with\\r\\nred-ruled notebook and pencil and made her way to a desk near a window,\\r\\na dissatisfied look on her face; she would have to get off those\\r\\nletters before she went home. Men opened and closed the drawers of\\r\\ntheir desks; then they, too, followed the girls down the stairs. One of\\r\\nthem raised his arms and yawned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This spring weather gets you,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut nobody answered. The moment of release had come; in every man’s\\r\\nmind was the thought of getting away, just as eight hours before they\\r\\nhad all been motivated by the idea of getting to work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take the ferry?” Brice Denison asked a man whose shoulders brushed his\\r\\nas they went out the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tube’s quicker,” the other said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve got some grass seed to get.” He plunged into the human\\r\\nstream rushing westward, battling against the other stream forging to\\r\\nthe east. Sometimes he could thread his way a step or two ahead of\\r\\nsomeone in front; sometimes he could do no more than keep pace with the\\r\\nonward moving crowd--a long step, a dozen short ones, looking for a\\r\\ngap, taking it, held again, then on. A street or two crossed, and the\\r\\neastward stream grew less; it was possible to make better progress, to\\r\\ndodge more, to pass a couple of girls or a man; to walk swiftly under\\r\\nmetal projections where halves of beef hung, and hogs with their sides\\r\\nheld out by wooden pieces displayed the inner sheathing of their ribs,\\r\\nand crates and baskets of vegetables lay open to the dust, and fruit\\r\\nstands were piled high with oranges and apples, and vendors’ carts\\r\\nlined the curb with boxed strawberries. The air freshened as Brice\\r\\nreached the street lined on one side with ferries. He paused at the\\r\\ndoor of a shop, and stood for a moment looking at the blue and purple\\r\\nand yellow blooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll take a couple of those,” he said, and thrust his hand into a\\r\\ntrousers-pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen over the broad street to the ferry house. Under a stairway the\\r\\nboy from whom he always bought the evening paper. He was recognized;\\r\\nthe paper he wanted was snatched from the pile and thrust at him, his\\r\\ncoins dropped into a waiting hand. Not a second was lost. Men hurrying\\r\\nto the ferry must not be delayed. Moments were precious, invaluable.\\r\\nThey were hastening home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were trains waiting on the other side. The ferry docked. Men\\r\\nrushed off, parting to right and left. Some glanced at the clock, then\\r\\nbegan to walk more slowly; others raced, and others went stolidly on\\r\\ntheir way, through the gates, on to forward cars. The forward cars got\\r\\nthere a moment sooner. Brice found a seat, put his baskets of pansies\\r\\nin the rack overhead, unfolded his evening paper. Other men were doing\\r\\nthe same thing. Their movements might have been directed as by an\\r\\norchestra leader. Headlines, first--they had seen them on news-stands,\\r\\nin other men’s hands, glanced at them in ferry or tube; then in unison,\\r\\nwith a swishing sound, up and down the car the papers were turned,\\r\\nfolded. The base-ball season was open. Tired men, with no time for\\r\\nplay, lost themselves in the printed accounts of the game. The train\\r\\nmoved out, a few late-comers passing along the aisle in the hope of\\r\\nfinding seats. A hand fell on Brice’s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why--hello there, Ned!” he said, as the other took the place at his\\r\\nside. “Haven’t seen you for ages!” A wave of self-consciousness passed\\r\\nover him; that was an inapt thing to say: no, he had not seen Ned Allen\\r\\nfor ages. But the other man ignored any awkwardness there might have\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How’s things?” he asked. “How’s Anne?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fine, fine! How’s Mabel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s well. Billy’s had measles. I see you’re still the same old\\r\\nfarmer, Brice!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice glanced overhead at his pansies. “Yes. But I had to buy a\\r\\nlawn-mower when we moved, Ned. Gosh--those were great old days!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other grinned. “Yes. I miss your tool chest. Like your new house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not so new, now. Three years, nearly four, isn’t it? By Jove, it’s\\r\\nfive!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Five--so it is! We still miss you. Movies near you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Oh, yes. Anne’s sort of lost interest. Things come along, you\\r\\nknow. You meet people, all that. I tell you what, Ned. We want you and\\r\\nMabel to come up to dinner some night. Make it soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s indefinite. We’ll do better than that. Anything on tonight?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well then, you and Anne hop on a train and come down. Or maybe you\\r\\nkeep a car?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No such luck!” said Brice, with a comforting warmth suddenly flaring\\r\\nwithin him; they had no car yet, but things were coming along.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right. You come down, and we’ll all go to the movies. Have a bite\\r\\non the chafing-dish afterwards. We’ve got a new one--electric. Be like\\r\\nold times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll do it!” said Brice, as the train stopped and Allen arose. “In\\r\\ntime for the second show, anyway.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not open his paper again. Good, that, to meet Ned, especially\\r\\ntoday. Good to think of old times. That little two-family house, Ned\\r\\nand Mabel in the apartment above. The lawn-mower that he borrowed\\r\\nfrom Ned when his turn came to cut the small plot of grass. The tools\\r\\nthat Ned borrowed in turn. Mabel and Anne going shopping together,\\r\\nsometimes on a matinée spree in town; small triumphs shared, simple\\r\\npleasures--good old times, particularly good to think about tonight.\\r\\nGood to have had them, good to have gone on to something else; good,\\r\\nvery good, still to be going on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train stopped at his station; he thrust his newspaper into a\\r\\nhip-pocket, took down the baskets of flowers. A short walk along the\\r\\nside of the tracks, a turn to the left and a block or two--it was not\\r\\nfar to his house; its convenience had been one of their reasons for\\r\\nchoosing it, but now its nearness to things had become insignificant.\\r\\nIts importance, its meaning had grown. It represented something more\\r\\nthan any other house on the street, even than the other houses that\\r\\nhe passed on the more important street. He never turned into the\\r\\nby-street without a quickening of the pulse. His eye never caught the\\r\\ngray stucco front with its roof of red tiles coming oddly down in a\\r\\nsweep incongruously borrowed from the Chinese without a warm sense of\\r\\nsatisfaction. That house was not like other houses; it was not like any\\r\\nother house on that street, even. They were all set on low terraces.\\r\\nSome were shingled, some stuccoed; some had red roofs, and others\\r\\nhad brown; some were painted in gray or yellow, with white trimmings\\r\\nand green blinds; some had two smaller windows on the front porch,\\r\\nsome had one larger. Those differences were due to the effulgence of\\r\\nthe builder’s imagination and to the real-estate man’s knowledge of\\r\\nsalesmanship. This was a neighborhood that was meant for nice people\\r\\nwith moderate incomes; at the time the houses were built there were\\r\\nno garages, though later several owners had built them, of cement or\\r\\ncorrugated metal, in the tiny back yards. People who lived in nice\\r\\nneighborhoods, however convenient to the commuters’ trains, did not\\r\\nwant to live in houses like all the other houses on the street. The\\r\\nfloor plans of all those on Lammermoor Place were as like as right\\r\\nand left gloves; but outside no two were alike. Individuality was the\\r\\nkeynote; individuality and a certain smart look. That was what made for\\r\\nquick sales. No need of substantial building. Looks, looks--that was\\r\\nwhat counted. It had counted with Brice and Anne; but now the house had\\r\\ntaken upon itself for Brice a personality of its own. It was home. He\\r\\nwas going home tonight with grass-seed for that bare spot on the lawn,\\r\\nand with pansies, and with something else. Anne would be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little girl on roller skates skidded up to him as he turned the\\r\\ncorner, threw herself upon him. He laughed, held out his hand, and the\\r\\nchild set her feet together and let him drag her along.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Denison’s just come home. She came in an automobile,” she said.\\r\\n“See--? She hasn’t got out yet, but she’s there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA long gray runabout, “the latest sports model,” was at the curb in\\r\\nfront of his house. Brice dropped the child’s hands as he reached it.\\r\\nHis eyes met Anne’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve brought her safe home, you see,” said the man at the wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks,” said Brice, dryly, without smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne jumped down, spoke a laughing word of farewell over her shoulder.\\r\\nThey went up the walk together. But in the hall she turned to him with\\r\\na look of resentment that was like a hand thrusting him away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think you might have been ordinarily polite to Ranney,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought I was,” said Brice; but without replying Anne started\\r\\nupstairs. He set his baskets of pansies on the hall table. From the\\r\\nlanding where the stairs turned she looked down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course if you really want to make a white spot on the hall table\\r\\nit’s quite all right to put those wet things there,” she said. He\\r\\nhastily took them up. “I can’t see why you like to come home looking\\r\\nlike a delivery boy, anyway,” she added, and went on up to her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice carried the pansies through a swinging door into the kitchen.\\r\\n“Hello, Lucille,” he said to a young colored woman who turned from the\\r\\nstove to greet him with an exceptional dental display.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My, ain’t them pretty!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I’m going to plant them along the porch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’ll be grand! Mis’ Denison’s awful fond of flowers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Got a tumbler or something?” Brice asked; he began picking off some of\\r\\nthe larger blossoms. The girl brought him a small slim vase which he\\r\\nheld under the faucet. Water splashed into the sink, spattered over his\\r\\nhands and coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll wipe you off,” said Lucille. “That faucet cuts up all the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Needs a new washer,” said Brice. “I’ll fix it tonight.” He carried the\\r\\nlittle vase into the dining-room, and in the doorway stopped short.\\r\\nThere were flowers on the table, white lilacs and deep red roses, and\\r\\nthrust between them some purple orchids, such a forced mingling of\\r\\nthe seasons as only the very rich can achieve. But Brice did not know\\r\\nthat. He wondered vaguely what Anne had paid for them. Then he set his\\r\\npansies in front of her place.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came down in a moment; she was always deft in her changes of\\r\\ncostume. It had not taken long, but she was fresh and elusively\\r\\nfragrant in a gown Brice had not seen before. She was smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You forgot to kiss me when you came in!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can make up for that,” Brice said. “You look like a party!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This?” she shrugged, turned herself about. “Do you like me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You bet I like you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLucille came in at the moment, and Anne slid into her chair at the\\r\\ntable. She glanced at the pansies, set the vase out of the way. During\\r\\nthe meal their talk was only casual. For the past few years Anne had\\r\\ninsisted that their one maid should wait upon the table as nearly as\\r\\npossible in the manner of the more highly-paid and trained servants of\\r\\nher friends. For a time Brice found the result diverting. Often it was\\r\\nludicrous enough. But even a humorous thing may become irksome; when\\r\\nthe novelty began to wear off, he had protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, let the girl eat her dinner in peace, Nance,” he said, “and give\\r\\nus a chance to be human and talk. I’m getting fed up with having her\\r\\nstand there by the pantry door, listening to every word we say, and\\r\\nstaring at me every time I put the fork to my mouth like a dog waiting\\r\\nfor a bone. Call it off, can’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Anne, decidedly. “If I don’t train her properly while we are\\r\\nalone, what can we do when we have guests?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let ’em get along as we do. Why not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s absurd,” she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until their evening meal was ended and they went into the\\r\\ngreater freedom of the living-room that there was anything more than\\r\\nbroken, polite exchanges of phrases between them. Brice’s gift of small\\r\\ntalk was largely lacking, and he saw that Anne had something on her\\r\\nmind. She was always preoccupied, when she had something on her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Coffee in the living-room, Lucille,” Anne said to the girl, from the\\r\\ndoorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice, already lighting his pipe, chuckled. Dinner had rested him.\\r\\nHis sense of humor was uppermost again, and Anne was lovely in the\\r\\nlight-colored gown. “You do keep it up, don’t you, old girl? You’re a\\r\\nwonder!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her quizzically over the flaming match. “Coffee--and\\r\\ndrawing-room. Gosh!” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see the absurdity of it as well as you do,” she retorted. “This\\r\\nroom----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice sobered a little. “Nothing the matter with this room,” he\\r\\ndeclared. “You’re a great hand at making a place home-like, old lady.\\r\\nMighty cozy in here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him for a moment; then she asked, quietly, “Is that\\r\\nreally your ideal, Brice? Cozy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, why not? Looks good to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bit her lip, crossed the floor to press the little button in an\\r\\nelectric lamp. He looked after her, added, “Not that I don’t wish it\\r\\nwere--well, finer, and larger, and all that--for your sake.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came slowly back. He had thrown himself into a stuffed arm-chair\\r\\nwhich was worn into a permanent impress of his figure. They had bought\\r\\nit during the first year of their marriage, made an event of buying it,\\r\\ncalled it his birthday present, that birthday being two months in the\\r\\nfuture. He had never been willing to have it banished to those regions\\r\\nabove where most of their early purchases filled spaces that would\\r\\notherwise be vacantly gaping. Pipe-smoke was whirling about his head.\\r\\nHe looked at her through its comforting haze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Nance,” he said. “Old Grant is going to resign. I’ve asked\\r\\nfor his job.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly her expression changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Brice! That will give us--how much does he get?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, twelve hundred, maybe fifteen hundred, more than I’m getting.\\r\\nBut I suppose they wouldn’t start me off with that, you know. Getting\\r\\nthe job’s the first thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you will get it. Of course you will. And even twelve hundred more!\\r\\nOh, Brice!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t count on it too soon, old girl. There’s Farren, you know. He has\\r\\nmore right to it than I have. And there’s always the chance of their\\r\\nbringing in a man from outside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! That wouldn’t be fair! And you’ve been there longer than Farren.\\r\\nTwelve hundred----”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colored maid, with her cap awry and a grin on her face, at that\\r\\nmoment backed through the portières that separated the dining-room from\\r\\nthe living-room, bearing a tray too large for the two coffee-cups it\\r\\nheld. She swung around to face Anne, and the coffee splashed over the\\r\\nrims of the cups to the saucers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where you want it at?” she asked, cheerily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will take it,” said Anne, with dignity, fully conscious of her\\r\\nhusband’s suppressed amusement. “And the smaller tray next time,\\r\\nLucille.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl disappeared. “None of that for me,” said Brice. “Keeps me\\r\\nawake.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s eyelids flickered. “You will need it tonight,” said she. “We are\\r\\ngoing out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s so!” said Brice, cheerfully, reaching up for a cup. “How’d you\\r\\nknow? Seen Mabel?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him, plainly surprised. “Mabel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mabel. Ran into old Ned on the train. Said he and Mabel had been\\r\\nwanting us over in the evening for a long time, and why not tonight. So\\r\\nI said we’d go. Of course. Don’t like to drop away from old friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOld friends. Ned, and Mabel. There flashed across Anne’s mind those\\r\\nfirst years of their married life, when she and Brice had had the\\r\\ndownstairs apartment; those days when Ned was beginning his career of\\r\\nselling insurance, when Brice had been so triumphant over getting the\\r\\nnew job with Whitten & Company. Yes, they were old friends. They had\\r\\nshared the lawn-mower, taken turns in clearing off the snow, gone to\\r\\nthe movies together, compared the price of groceries, run in and out\\r\\nhalf a dozen times a day. Those grubby years, that she was so glad to\\r\\nhave come away from. She hated to be reminded of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry, Brice, I promised Tessie Ogden we’d go there for bridge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but look here! Mrs. Ogden won’t mind. Can’t hurt old Ned’s\\r\\nfeelings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want to hurt them. We’ll have them here to dinner some time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s been years since we were there, Nance. And I said we’d go.\\r\\nThey’ll have gotten things ready--you know how hospitable Mabel is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne knew. The latest record for the phonograph, perhaps a game of\\r\\nfive-hundred or the movies, and at the end of the evening something\\r\\non the chafing-dish, with Mabel explaining where she had discovered\\r\\nthe recipe. Anne knew all of it. The scurrying of Mabel to get things\\r\\nin order, Ned hurrying across the tracks to the delicatessen store.\\r\\nMabel’s discussion with ten-year-old Florence about bed-time, Billy’s\\r\\ncalls for a drink of water. An endless retailing of jokes Ned had read\\r\\nin the paper, by way of conversation. Oh, Anne knew it all; whenever\\r\\nshe thought of it she thanked the stars of her destiny that they had\\r\\nhelped her get away from it. Even as it was, she had not got very far;\\r\\nbut not back to that, not back to that. She thought of Tessie Ogden,\\r\\nwith her languid voice, thought of the richness of Tessie’s house, of\\r\\nthe people who would be there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll telephone Mabel, Brice,” she said. “I can’t possibly disappoint\\r\\nTessie.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice sat up. His pipe had gone out, and he sent an exploring thumb\\r\\ninto its depths. “I can’t see Tessie’s being disappointed, Nance, by\\r\\nour not turning up. But Mabel--and old Ned----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry, Brice. We shall have to go to Tessie’s. It’s bridge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well--that’s all the more reason, then. I told you before, Nance, I am\\r\\nnot going to play bridge with that bunch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up, moved about restlessly. If only Brice would not make\\r\\nhimself so hard to manage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you need not be afraid, this time, of losing,” she said. “Tessie\\r\\ntold me to say that she’d be your partner. She always wins.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice stood up, crossed to the mantel for tobacco. “Sweet thing,\\r\\nTessie,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne flared. “She’s no worse than the facts. The fact is that my\\r\\nhusband is too--too----”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice supplied the word. “Stingy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You said it, not I! But there it is, and everybody knows it, taunts me\\r\\nabout it. Laughs at me, probably, when I’m not there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you care?” Brice looked at her with an oddly lifted eyebrow, a\\r\\ntrick of his that she used to love. Now it exasperated her because it\\r\\nwas always the sign that Brice was opposing his will to hers. “What do\\r\\nyou care what those people think or even say, Nance? What the dickens\\r\\ndo they _matter_?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are my friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But are they? What do they mean to you, what would they do for you,\\r\\nwhat----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tessie, at least, would play as my husband’s partner to keep him from\\r\\nlosing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice sat down. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees, his\\r\\nfingers fumbling over his pipe, his eyes on an unimportant figure of\\r\\nthe rug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne,” he said slowly, after a moment of thought, “it does seem funny\\r\\nto have to try to make you understand. Can’t you, without our saying\\r\\nanything?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe managed to smile; one prettily shod foot was swaying a little. “But\\r\\nif you play with Tessie, Brice, this time you’ll win,” she told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bit his lip. “Look here, Nance,” he said, looking across at her.\\r\\n“I hate like the dickens to can anything you want to do, or anything\\r\\nyou like to do. But this playing bridge for money. Honest, old girl, I\\r\\ncan’t choke it down. It’s not playing a square deal with our life, our\\r\\nincome being what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everybody does it. And you’ll win, if you----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everybody does not do it. You may call me anything you like, but under\\r\\nthe circumstances I don’t think it’s decent. Even if you can afford\\r\\nit--and you and I cannot, Nance--it’s a mere rushing into something for\\r\\nthe sake of excitement, unwholesome excitement. If you can’t afford it,\\r\\nit’s all the worse. I am not gambling. If I have anything to do with\\r\\nit, my wife doesn’t gamble, either.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You played the other night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did. I’m sorry I did. I felt like a cheap skate while I was doing\\r\\nit. But we were there, and I’d have broken up the party if I stayed\\r\\nout. My having lost has nothing to do with my being unwilling to play\\r\\nagain. I’m glad I lost. Served me right for being a coward.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You lost three dollars and forty cents. Was that much, for an\\r\\nevening’s amusement?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. But it has nothing whatever to do with it. I gambled, and I am not\\r\\ngoing to gamble again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment she was too angry to speak; then she stood up. “Brice,”\\r\\nshe said, “I don’t think you quite appreciate what I am trying to do\\r\\nfor you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think you’re a peach, Nance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head moved impatiently. “You don’t know how hard I have tried to\\r\\nknow the right people. You----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter with Alice’s set?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing. Alice is my best friend. She has always been, ever since we\\r\\nwere born. I met you at her house. But you know what Alice is, as well\\r\\nas I do. She’s always had everything. She doesn’t want anything more.\\r\\nShe’s in a rut, and glad she’s in a rut, so long as George and the\\r\\nchildren are there with her. The people I have worked hard to know and\\r\\nmake friends with, for your sake, are people who are not in a rut. They\\r\\nare rising people. And they’re the right people. You don’t understand\\r\\nhow hard it is to keep up with them. I struggle and struggle, and you\\r\\ndon’t try to help me at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure I’ll help you! But after all, why the struggle? Where’s it going\\r\\nto get you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not thinking about myself. I’m thinking about you, your future.\\r\\nIt’s all so I can further your interests.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face clouded. “Where do my interests come in? We’re getting along.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh--getting along! You’ll never be a success until you know the right\\r\\npeople. There’s DeLancey Hunt--he’s made over a hundred thousand\\r\\nthis last year, they say. Meg’s got a new sedan, and Jack gave her a\\r\\nsapphire bracelet on her birthday. There’s Burson, and Harry Claflin,\\r\\nand the Averys. I don’t have to go over the list. The thing is that\\r\\nthey are successful. And you will never be successful until you get in\\r\\nwith them, know their ways, make friends of them. They can do things\\r\\nfor you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t thrill over that, you know. I don’t want to climb by means of\\r\\nfriends. Nor of people you and I play around with.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know you don’t. That’s just what I’ve been telling you. You don’t\\r\\nhelp----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much’ll it help to let Mrs. Ogden keep me from losing money at\\r\\nbridge?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ignored that. “There’s Ranney Copeland--you think so much of George\\r\\nand Alice, you ought to approve of Ranney. He’s George’s brother. But\\r\\nwhat do you do, the very first time he offers to help you? You turn him\\r\\ndown flat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like Ranney Copeland. And I will not play stocks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because you’re afraid!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I am afraid. I’m not ashamed of that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I am! You’ve got to push ahead as these other men do, if you’re\\r\\ngoing to get anywhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was silence between them for a full minute. Then he said, slowly,\\r\\n“Anne, we seem to be talking a different language, these days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it’s because you won’t look at life as it is. You won’t put your\\r\\nhand out nor make any move to get ahead. You wait until some change\\r\\nin the office shoves you into a better place. You won’t see things\\r\\nthat----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But life has a good many sides to it, old girl. We used to look at the\\r\\nsame side, together, and not think it so bad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what was it? What was it, but----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not so bad,” he repeated, “not so bad. Just what a good many millions\\r\\nof other men and other women are looking at, and finding it good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waved a hand, indicating the room they were in, and laughed--not\\r\\njoyously. “This?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes, this--or something like it. Looks all right to me. Meant a\\r\\ngood deal to us, getting these things together. Watched the house being\\r\\nbuilt--remember? Pretty good, first time I came home to it and found\\r\\nyou in the kitchen with a smudge on your nose. Still is pretty good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Honestly, Brice, is that all the ambition you have?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not all. No. I’d like to see you in a limousine of your own, and a\\r\\nhouse on a hill-top, if you wanted it. But, after all, whether they’re\\r\\nbig and showy or not, the things men work for and want are just about\\r\\nthe same. Those other fellows, the ones whose wives you’re running\\r\\naround with, don’t have any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t have any more!” she repeated, incredulously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. Home. Money enough to get by with. A wife, and--and children.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clasped her hands together. “Oh! I’m glad, glad, glad there are no\\r\\nchildren!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was staring again at the figure in the rug. “Yes,” he said, slowly,\\r\\n“I have known your feeling about that for some time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe jumped up, started to speak, but, instead, went out of the room. He\\r\\nheard her step overhead. Presently he went to the telephone and spoke\\r\\nwith Ned Allen. Then for an hour or more he sat in the arm-chair, his\\r\\nbody in its familiar sag to the left; sat there with his pipe, his eyes\\r\\nstill exploring the intricacies of the pattern of the rug as a sick\\r\\nman will follow the lines of the wall-paper, idly, perhaps--or perhaps\\r\\nweaving into them strange figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning she awoke to a spatter from the bath-room--Brice, as\\r\\nusual, running off all the hot water while he shaved. But immediately\\r\\nanother thought came to her. Old Mr. Grant was going to resign. Twelve\\r\\nhundred a year more, maybe fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the breakfast table she was smiling, debonnair, fresh and youthful\\r\\nlooking in one of the simple ginghams that Brice loved. Owing to the\\r\\ndemands of the day’s work, at breakfast the maid did not preside, and\\r\\nno cap was in evidence. Brice liked his coffee hot from the stove, so\\r\\nAnne brought it in herself and poured in a goodly portion of cream.\\r\\nAlways, with Brice, each day began itself; there was no hanging over of\\r\\nthe discussion of the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When does Mr. Grant go?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice grinned across at her. “Now don’t you go counting on that too\\r\\nmuch, old lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But of course you’ll get it. I am going to see Alice about it today.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked blank. “Alice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course. George Copeland is a stockholder in Whitten & Company.\\r\\nA word from him----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, please, Nance! You don’t understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer good humor was not to be shaken. “That is just what I was trying to\\r\\ntell you last night, my dear. Everything is done through friendship,\\r\\nnowadays. That is just the value of my having worked so hard to make\\r\\nthe friends I have. A word from George Copeland--I rather think nobody\\r\\nwill disregard that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my dear girl! Look here--you can’t do that. I won’t have it. It\\r\\nwouldn’t do any good, but I won’t have it. Think of the position it’d\\r\\nput me in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very well. You’ll get it, of course, anyway. And Brice, the\\r\\nDodsons want to sell their car.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up, laughed, came around the table and bent over her. “Don’t you\\r\\ngo thinking about a car yet, my child. Plenty of time for that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came back from the hall and kissed her again. She was all but\\r\\nunconscious of it, yet when the front door had closed behind him she\\r\\nsat there thinking about him. Brice, and their life together. Ten\\r\\nyears. What was it that Barrie had called it? Mid-channel, where the\\r\\nwaters were deepest, the seas most rough. Mid-channel, where the danger\\r\\nwas. But there could be no danger in her case. As a matter of fact,\\r\\nshe thought any woman was rather stupid to let danger come after ten\\r\\nyears of experience. Of course, those first years of adjustment were\\r\\ndifficult enough. She remembered days when she had thrown herself on\\r\\nthe bed and wept, for reasons long since forgotten. She remembered\\r\\nthose moments when little futile discussions had arisen between them\\r\\nuntil they loomed like horrible dark barriers they could never cross to\\r\\ncome heart to heart together again. She remembered how furious she was\\r\\nwhen Brice brought carnations on their first anniversary, forgetting\\r\\nthat she loathed the stiff scent-laden things and adored daffodils. And\\r\\nshe remembered how the next day she wept, and kissed the empty sleeve\\r\\nof his coat in the closet, because Ned Allen had let it out that Brice\\r\\nhad gone without luncheon for four days in order to buy them. Oh, it\\r\\nwas difficult enough to adjust one’s self to marriage, at first. But\\r\\none learned. Certainly she had learned in those ten years what to\\r\\navoid, where to persist, how to work quietly, when to be tender and\\r\\nyielding. Men did not learn as readily. Even now Brice did not trust\\r\\nher to know what was best for them. Yet she knew how to manage him. In\\r\\nthe end he always came round to her way of thinking. He was going to do\\r\\nthat now. For she wanted things, so many things. There was no harm in\\r\\nwanting them. The other women whom she had come to know during the past\\r\\nthree or four years all had them. Their husbands were no cleverer than\\r\\nBrice. It was only that their attitude towards life was different,\\r\\ntheir way of looking at things that made them successful men. She could\\r\\ndiscover no other reason for it. She must, must, somehow, make Brice\\r\\nsee things as they did. The rest would follow; and she wanted the rest,\\r\\nwanted it so.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the flowers on the dining-table for a moment, and a slow\\r\\nsmile came to her face. It was good of Ranney Copeland to have sent\\r\\nthem; he was always doing things like that. They must have fresh water.\\r\\nShe divided them, taking some into the living-room. In the merciless\\r\\nrevealing sunlight not even her determination could make it look\\r\\ngay like Tessie Ogden’s. Nor like Alice Copeland’s, with its sedate\\r\\nexpensiveness. There was Brice’s old chair, with the cushions sagging\\r\\nto the left. That, alone, kept it in the class of the one-living-room\\r\\nhouse. The other things had been bought when they moved here from the\\r\\ntwo-family house. Then they had been achievements, definite advances in\\r\\nprice and taste over anything they had possessed before. Now she saw\\r\\nthem for what they were, understood their incongruity, their--her mind\\r\\nformed the word--their hideousness. Chairs, department-store Colonial.\\r\\nToo glossy. The rug that had seemed so fine, and the one small Oriental\\r\\nin front of the mantel, a later purchase whose price she had managed\\r\\nto keep from Brice. The one good piece, an Empire sofa, that somehow\\r\\nmade all the rest look sordid. That, too, a later purchase, bought\\r\\nunder Alice Copeland’s advice, at a price which Alice declared a real\\r\\nbargain, but one that had cost Anne some heart-burnings when Brice sat\\r\\nfor two evenings over their household accounts because he would not\\r\\nconsent to buying on the installment plan. That lamp on the table was\\r\\nan earlier purchase. Mabel and Ned had come down to admire it the day\\r\\nit came home. Perhaps she had been a little hard about Mabel and Ned\\r\\nlast night; but one had to do hard things, sometimes, for good to come\\r\\nout of them. It was like surgery. Not pleasant, but sometimes necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door bell buzzed in the back of the house. She jumped up, then\\r\\nsat down again and took up a piece of embroidery. It rang again, and\\r\\nLucille poked her head around the door from the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You answer the do’ bell?” she asked cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not,” said Anne. “Don’t forget your white apron.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl brought in a couple of letters and a magazine. “Get the little\\r\\ntray from the hall-table and bring them in on that, please, Lucille,”\\r\\nAnne said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letters were not interesting. She usually found herself bored with\\r\\nmagazines. One had to look them over, just as one had to read the\\r\\nnovels that were being talked about and the headlines of newspapers.\\r\\nShe went to the telephone and called up the grocery-man. More than once\\r\\nBrice had suggested that she could do better by going to the store\\r\\nherself, that the morning walk would do her good. But what was the\\r\\nuse? You were only tempted to buy more when you saw things displayed,\\r\\nand she hated to dress for the street early in the morning. Besides,\\r\\nwith this new prospect ahead of them, this new increase of salary,\\r\\nthere would be less need of being careful. Careful--how she hated being\\r\\ncareful. Brice even wanted her to keep accounts, as if it helped any\\r\\nto know what the money had been spent for, after it was gone. Brice\\r\\ndidn’t realize how much she saved, anyway. On her clothes, for example.\\r\\nShe had rather a flair for clothes. It interested her to contrive them\\r\\nout of little or nothing. Yes, little or nothing, since all she paid\\r\\nfor was the material. People wondered how she managed to have so many\\r\\ndresses, but that was because she made them, of course with the help\\r\\nof a cheap little seamstress. There was a dress on the figure upstairs\\r\\nnow that the seamstress had left for her to finish. She went up. If she\\r\\nhurried, she could wear it that afternoon. Alice Copeland was coming to\\r\\ntake her to the country club. It was horrid, not having a car of one’s\\r\\nown. The Dodsons bought a new car every year; the one they would sell\\r\\nnow was really as good as new. Brice would not refuse her that. She\\r\\nwould not have to contrive for it as she had for the country-club dues.\\r\\nAnd he would not refuse to use the car, as he had persistently refused\\r\\nto go to the club with her, say what she would about the desirable\\r\\npeople to be met there. The dues were only a hundred and eighty, after\\r\\nall; and one did not have to have extras, in spite of what Brice\\r\\nmaintained. But that twelve hundred more they were going to have, or\\r\\nfifteen hundred, would certainly ease things. Perhaps she would not get\\r\\nthe car this year, after all. That would make Brice happier. How he\\r\\ndid love to save. And there was always Alice. Alice was always willing\\r\\nto give her a lift. Everyone knew they were almost like sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had always been like that, except a little less intimately during\\r\\nthe first few years of her marriage, when she was in that first flush\\r\\nof excitement at being married to Brice and having a place of their\\r\\nown, and Alice was busy with her babies. She and Alice and Nicky--they\\r\\nhad had good times together when they were children in the up-state\\r\\ntown where her father, Professor Warren, was principal of the high\\r\\nschool, and Alice’s father had owned the big mills. Anne, motherless,\\r\\nwas in a sense everyone’s child. There was old Miss Willy, her father’s\\r\\nhousekeeper, who did what she could; and Veronica’s mother on one side\\r\\nand the doctor’s family on the other. Anne was as much at home in both\\r\\nhouses as in her father’s. Doctor Clark she adored, but there was a\\r\\nperpetual feud between herself and the doctor’s only son, Ambrose.\\r\\nNeither Anne nor Ambrose ever thought about the reason for the feud.\\r\\nIt was enough that Veronica was Anne’s “most intimate friend,” and\\r\\nthat Ambrose was forever wanting Nicky to stop playing with the girls\\r\\nand help him with some of the strange machines he was always trying\\r\\nto make. As for Nicky, her disposition towards the opposite sex was\\r\\nordained before she was born. There awaited her arrival five brothers\\r\\nof her own and one Ambrose, who lived only two houses away, one\\r\\never-adoring Ambrose. Emphatically, Veronica took them all lightly.\\r\\nAlice was a plump, homely, shy little girl, an adoring slave of both\\r\\nAnne and Nicky, and always a little afraid of the boys. Naturally\\r\\nenough, it was Alice who had married first, just as it was natural that\\r\\nshe should have married even more money than her father possessed. She\\r\\nwas still a good deal the same sort of person as ever, plump and mild,\\r\\ngenerous, sentimental; having no troubles of her own, she wore the\\r\\nburden of others’ troubles on her heart, was forever being distressed\\r\\nabout something. Lately it had been about Veronica. Why should Nicky\\r\\npersist in scorning marriage? Why wouldn’t she take Ambrose? Why did\\r\\nshe live in that horrible, slummy part of the city? Why did she let\\r\\nherself come into contact with all sorts of grubby people, even have\\r\\nthem at her rooms? Why should any woman on earth want to work, when\\r\\nshe might have a nice home of her own and darling children? Those were\\r\\nAlice’s arguments, at which Nicky laughed and wrinkled up her eyes at\\r\\nAnne, or at Ambrose if he were present. Yet in her heart Anne agreed\\r\\nmore with Alice than with Veronica.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked about it that afternoon on the way to the country club.\\r\\n“Yes,” Anne said, “I do think she’d be happier married. Ambrose would\\r\\nbe easy to manage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are both coming out to dinner tomorrow,” Alice said. “Will you\\r\\nand Brice come, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Love to. I don’t think Brice and Ambrose see very much of each other,\\r\\nthese days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Men are not like us in that,” Alice remarked. “When women don’t see\\r\\neach other often there seems to be a lessening of intimacy after a\\r\\nwhile, with most of us, anyway. Men take up where they left off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never thought about it,” Anne returned lightly. “I know Brice and\\r\\nAmbrose are awfully fond of each other. Of course, Ambrose detests me.\\r\\nHe’s never forgiven me for marrying Brice, though he did introduce us.\\r\\nHe thinks I’m not good enough for Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne, you do exaggerate so,” Alice protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no I don’t. I never got on with Ambrose when we were children. I\\r\\ndon’t get on with him now. I think he’s stupid, if you ask me. But he’s\\r\\ndone awfully well. I don’t see why Nicky won’t have him. She’d still\\r\\nhave her own way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that mild spring afternoon some of the women were out on the links;\\r\\nothers followed along, commenting, chatting, languidly paying tribute\\r\\nto the call of the season. Others sat for a while in the sun on the\\r\\ngreat rounded porch that hung above the first tee, Anne among them.\\r\\nA few days of brisk breeze had dried the grass, but Anne did not\\r\\nlike walking. She waited with Mrs. Ogden until Alice and the others\\r\\nreturned. Then, in the sudden coolness of the late afternoon, they all\\r\\nwent indoors together.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tea, all you people,” Alice Copeland said. “My party.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the hour that Anne liked best. Usually a man or two dropped\\r\\nin. Today there was only one, Ranney Copeland, who was devoting\\r\\nhimself to a young bride. But now and again his eyes turned towards\\r\\nAnne. She appeared oblivious, though as the talk went on her gayety\\r\\nincreased. She was standing at one end of the mantel, teacup in hand.\\r\\nThe firelight slid on the silk over her arm, played on the long line\\r\\nof her hip, touched one side of her face to rosiness, emphasizing her\\r\\nslimness, enhancing her air of youthfulness that for all her thirty-two\\r\\nyears was not wholly fictitious. She was conscious of being well\\r\\nplaced. She liked to feel herself poised, graceful, elegant from the\\r\\narch of her foot to the smooth bands of hair under the close hat. She\\r\\nliked to be standing at ease while other women were seated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I,” she was saying across the steaming tea, “am what the\\r\\nscientists call a throw-back. I’m the typical old-fashioned woman. It’s\\r\\nthe mental attitude that counts. Mine, you know very well, Jane, is the\\r\\nsweet, old-fashioned one. I’m sure you have noticed it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a Callot model,” Ranney Copeland remarked. “Or is it a Paquin?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne threw him a swift smile, and stirred her tea; but not before\\r\\nshe had caught an exchange of glances between two of the women, and\\r\\na raised eyebrow. Oh yes, the women understood about her clothes.\\r\\nStill, she knew how to wear them. Even Alice, with all her money, never\\r\\nsucceeded in looking as well turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that why you didn’t show up for bridge last night?” Mrs. Ogden\\r\\ninquired. “So you could hold Brice’s hand in front of the fire, or\\r\\nsomething?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” Anne said calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t the old-fashioned woman always capture her husband’s\\r\\npay-envelope on Saturday nights?” another woman asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne tilted her chin a little, looked down. “Darling,” she drawled,\\r\\nwith an emphasis too tender.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What Nance means to imply,” said Tessie Ogden, who had been twice\\r\\ndivorced, “is that she is all for the sweet sanctity of the family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks, dear,” Anne laughed. “How well you understand me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just the same, I don’t blame Nellie Callum for going to Reno,” said\\r\\nthe speaker Anne had first answered. “Though goodness knows, even\\r\\nthat’s getting to be old-fashioned enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope she stayed at the hotel I advised,” Mrs. Ogden remarked. “And I\\r\\ngave her a letter to my lawyer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled again. “I’m so old-fashioned that I think marriage is\\r\\nabsolutely sacred. I think I even go further. It’s so sacred that one\\r\\nought to keep on trying and trying it, until everyone’s satisfied. Like\\r\\nyou, Tessie dear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little bride’s eyes were round, but the others laughed. Only Alice\\r\\nCopeland looked distressed. “Nance never means half she says,” she\\r\\nprotested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but I do, dear. That’s part of my Early Victorianism, my utter\\r\\nsincerity,” Anne returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Copeland stood up, and the party drifted towards the place where\\r\\ntheir wraps were. On the wide porch of the club-house Anne heard a\\r\\nvoice at her shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are wonderful, Nance,” Ranney Copeland was saying. “Just how much\\r\\nof that did you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled. “I wonder!” she said, demurely.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Alice had heard, too. She turned, gave her brother-in-law a direct\\r\\nlook. “She didn’t mean a word of it, Ranney. And I won’t have you\\r\\ntalking to Anne like that, in whispers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRanney grinned. “Sweet small Cerberus,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You needn’t be rude,” Mrs. Copeland said. “I just stated a fact. Are\\r\\nyou coming, Anne?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pardon me,” said Ranney. “Not my intention to be rude, my dear girl.\\r\\nBut, Alice--one has often thought of it--just how much good as a\\r\\nwatch-dog do you suppose old Cerberus was? One seems to have heard of a\\r\\ngood many people who successfully crossed that river.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice had stepped into her car. “Come on, Anne,” she said, with no\\r\\nfurther look at the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped between Anne and the car, with a flash of the eyes at her\\r\\nthat she did not lose. “Anne promised to let me take her home. What\\r\\nelse do you suppose I came out for?” he said coolly to Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice Copeland turned her head. Anne said, rather too quickly, “Sorry,\\r\\ndear. I forgot to mention it. You don’t mind?” Whereupon Mrs.\\r\\nCopeland’s car sped ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had spun through the country-club gates, Anne spoke. “It is\\r\\nreally very thoughtful of you to give me a lift,” she said. “You knew,\\r\\nas I did, that Alice was longing to get home to the babies. And I do\\r\\nlive so out of the way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man at the wheel looked at her with a slow smile. “As you remarked\\r\\nto Tessie just now, ‘Thanks, dear. How well you understand me.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey laughed. Then Anne gave him an upward glance. “The flowers were\\r\\nlovely, Ranney.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can do so little,” he said, in a low tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on for half a mile in silence, then abruptly Anne spoke, her\\r\\nhands folded tightly together in her lap, her look straining ahead.\\r\\n“Oh, I hate it all! All!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis lips twisted. “Then you put up a pretty good front, my dear girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I do hate it. The petty economies, the subterfuges that they all\\r\\nsee through.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should worry! You can out-talk the best of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh--talk! As if that were all of it. I know what I have a right to--I\\r\\nknow what I owe myself. I know how I get it, I know what I have to put\\r\\nup with to keep it. No one else knows, though they think they do. They\\r\\ncan’t, because there’s so much of it. And I hate it, hate not having\\r\\nthings, not being able to meet them on their own ground, hate living as\\r\\nI do, where I do. I hate not having even a car of my own, having to\\r\\ndepend on charity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis car rounded a turn of the road, slipped ahead. “The charity is from\\r\\nyou to me,” he told her. “And I’ve told you how you can very easily\\r\\nmanage the rest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know, Ranney. But Brice will not hear of it. Money in the bank.\\r\\nThat’s as far as his imagination will let him go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s perfectly safe, my dear girl. Didn’t you tell him that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I told him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s done every day. I can’t quite get his point of view, you know. A\\r\\nquick turn-over. No need of putting back any more than your original\\r\\ninvestment. You’d always have that, and the profits are yours to do as\\r\\nyou like with. It’s perfectly simple. I should be very glad----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s no use, Ranney. He simply will not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let him go to some other broker, then. I can’t bear to see you----”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. “To see it----! But I have to endure it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent a moment. Then he asked, “Look here, Anne, just how\\r\\nmuch of all that did you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had forgotten her wild talk at the club. Her mind had been\\r\\ntraveling fast and far, had come back into more familiar country than\\r\\nthat speaker’s platform by the mantelpiece. “Of what?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you said about marriage. Just--how--old-fashioned are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer heart seemed to leap. She felt a cold breeze on her cheek.\\r\\nHer lips could scarcely articulate. She leaned forward a little.\\r\\n“I--don’t--know,” she whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better let me out at the corner,” she said, later, and walked slowly\\r\\nup the little street with the houses all trying to be different yet\\r\\nall so alike. Brice was already home. He had set out the pansies along\\r\\nthe front of the porch, and was running a lawn-mower. She hated the\\r\\nlawn-mower, but at sight of Brice a quick touch of compunction swept\\r\\nover her. A sandy-haired man somewhere in his middle thirties, his\\r\\nbroad frame was already becoming stooped from desk work. His clothes\\r\\nwere inconspicuous, a little shabby, everyday clothes worn season\\r\\nbefore last for best, now thriftily used for the office. There was a\\r\\nsort of doggedness in the way he pushed the lawn-mower. Anne knew he\\r\\nwas tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped when she turned into the short cement walk that led to the\\r\\nporch, and laughed, rubbing a hand upward over his brow. “Hello, old\\r\\ngirl! Thought I’d get done before you caught me at it,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled at him. His eyes took in all her spring prettiness. “I\\r\\nbelieve you really do like it,” she said. “Just the same, I wish you\\r\\nwouldn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it’s good exercise. Gosh--a day like this makes you want to get\\r\\nout and dig, or go fishing or something, doesn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was lovely at the country club,” she told him. “Alice and some of\\r\\nthe others played golf. The dogwood is out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no news as to who would be chosen for Grant’s place. “Don’t\\r\\ncount on it too much,” he told her when he kissed her good-by the next\\r\\nmorning. “It may be a week before we know, anyway.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hands on his arms. “Don’t think of it that way, Brice. You\\r\\nlet things slide along so. Make them give it to you. You know you’re a\\r\\nbetter man for the job than Farren.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face softened. “Think a lot of the old man, don’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well--of course,” she said, and kissed him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went upstairs still with that sense of compunction. All the evening\\r\\nbefore, all this morning, she had been very gentle with Brice. He was\\r\\nso good. Of course he needed prodding. With another sort of wife he\\r\\nwould not have gotten ahead at all. He would have been like all the\\r\\nother men on the street, humdrum, satisfied, smug. When they first\\r\\nmoved there he had rather tentatively scraped acquaintance with some\\r\\nof them. She had been right, quite right, to put a stop to that. She\\r\\nhad learned her lesson. Their earlier friendship with Mabel and Ned\\r\\nAllen had blocked their making other friends until they moved. Even\\r\\nbefore the new house was ready she had made up her mind to know only\\r\\nthe right people thereafter. She had met some at Alice’s; through them\\r\\nshe told herself she would meet more. And she had. Brice might walk up\\r\\nthe street with the men, or talk a little when he was out with that\\r\\nmiserable lawn-mower; she bowed to the women, and saw to it that their\\r\\nacquaintance went no further. Impossible to mix sets. Now things were\\r\\ncoming their way at last. That extra fifteen hundred. Poor old Brice.\\r\\nIt had not been quite fair of her to talk like that, even among the\\r\\nwomen she had to amuse. For she did have to amuse them. Wild talk,\\r\\nquick talk--what else had she to offer them? They liked it, accepted\\r\\nher assumption that she was one of them, that only by the circumstance\\r\\nof Brice’s not having got on as fast as other men was she unable to go\\r\\nthe whole pace with them. They were kind enough, for the most part.\\r\\nOccasional snubs did not matter. Tessie Ogden was a good sort, in spite\\r\\nof her varied matrimonial ventures; she had no end of money. One could\\r\\nnot afford to be too conservative, unless, of course, one had wealth\\r\\nand position like Alice’s. Alice could afford to hold Mrs. Ogden at\\r\\narm’s length. Alice could afford anything. Any Copeland could. Ranney\\r\\nCopeland, as well as Alice’s humdrum George.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer thoughts brought her up short, there. What had Ranney meant by\\r\\nhis question of the afternoon before? She flushed. After all, what\\r\\nshe had said was true. They had thought it a joke, all those others.\\r\\nShe really was an old-fashioned woman. Divorce? It was grubby, rather\\r\\ndisgusting, on the whole. A woman’s job was not to go hunting for one\\r\\nman after another, but to make the man she had married. As she intended\\r\\nto make Brice. Good old Brice. She had forgotten to tell him to get\\r\\nhome early. They were going to Alice’s. Perhaps he would like to meet\\r\\nAmbrose, come out with him. She went to the telephone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s dinners were always sedate and somewhat elaborate; Anne envied\\r\\nthe perfection of service, and always had an eye to the novelty of the\\r\\nhors d’œuvres. This evening there were only the six of them and Alice’s\\r\\nolder little girl, who had begged to stay up to see Aunt Nicky. She\\r\\nwas a dark, spindling little thing, with a rather disconcerting habit\\r\\nof staring. After dinner she slipped her hand in Veronica’s, and when\\r\\nher mother insisted that she must go up to bed wound her arms and legs\\r\\nabout Nicky and clung to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I don’t want to go,” she protested.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky somehow unwound her, held her off a little in front of her.\\r\\n“Elizabeth,” she said, seriously, “that’s the best reason in the world\\r\\nfor not doing a thing. Never do anything you don’t want to do. Unless\\r\\nyou have to. This is one of the times that you have to. So--scoot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the child had departed George Copeland laughed. “You know I don’t\\r\\naltogether go along with your philosophy, Veronica, my child,” said\\r\\nhe. He was a tall man, heavy and dark, usually shy. It was generally\\r\\nsupposed that he liked everyone a little, no one very much, and that in\\r\\nbusiness he knew how to drive a sharp bargain. Alice adored him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“George,” Nicky said, looking up at him, “you’re six feet of sham. It’s\\r\\nprecisely your own philosophy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice flushed a little. “At any rate, Nicky,” said she, “we’ll admit\\r\\nit is yours. You certainly do only what you want to. And I must say I\\r\\nthink they’re queer things, sometimes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica stared for an instant, then settled back in her chair. “Ah,”\\r\\nsaid she. “I thought you and Ambrose had your heads together at dinner.\\r\\nI see he’s told you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked Anne. “You’re always quarreling, you two.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not been quarreling,” Ambrose declared, setting his coffee cup\\r\\non a table. “But there are things I object to. I’ll admit I said that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I think you are right, Ambrose,” said Alice. “Nicky will persist\\r\\nin living alone in a queer part of the city. That’s stupid, as I see\\r\\nit. Anne agrees with me. I don’t think any woman living alone ought to\\r\\nfill up her place with people off the street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky laughed. “One person, please. But it does rather fill up the\\r\\nplace. I have to sleep on the sofa.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t even know the girl,” Ambrose affirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her name seems to be Stella,” said Nicky. “She says she’s a thief. And\\r\\nnone too straight otherwise. Also she was uncommonly hungry. So what\\r\\ncould I do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will you do?” Brice Denison asked, smiling a little, leaning\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I came out for,” said Nicky, calmly. “I’ve got to give her\\r\\na chance to get away from her man, you see. And I’m broke.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not your affair, I tell you,” said Ambrose, savagely. “Turn her\\r\\nout, if she hasn’t already left with everything you possess.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It certainly is not your affair, Ambrose,” Nicky returned. “How much\\r\\nis it yours, George?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you put it up to George?” Alice asked quickly. “If it’s money\\r\\nyou want----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I do,” said Nicky.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is she married?” Alice asked again.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Copeland said, kindly, ponderously, “Oh, come now, Alice. How\\r\\nmuch do you need, Nicky?”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky grinned up at him. “It’s not one of the times you have to, you\\r\\nknow, George!”\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge’s hand went into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour or two later, when the women had gone upstairs for wraps, Anne\\r\\nsaid, “Why not come back with us for the night, Nicky? You won’t have\\r\\nto sleep on the sofa and I think I have some clothes you might use for\\r\\nyour--thief.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky laughed. “Thanks. I’ll come. So I won’t have to go back in the\\r\\ntrain with Ambrose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice looked troubled. “Why do you pretend to hate Ambrose?” she asked.\\r\\n“You don’t really, you know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky was putting on her hat in front of a glass. “Well, no. I think\\r\\nI’m rather in love with him, really. Anyway, part of the time. But\\r\\nthis business of marriage----!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the only real happiness,” Alice said solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica turned, eyebrows raised. “Are you happy, Alice? Are you, Anne?\\r\\nAre George and Brice happy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course we are!” Alice cried, flushing. Anne echoed, “Of course we\\r\\nare!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky looked from one to the other. “Of course and of course you are!\\r\\nGreat institution, this marriage, isn’t it? Nothing to equal it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Anne watched Brice and Veronica walk off towards the\\r\\nstation together. She had gone through her closets and found a number\\r\\nof last year’s things for Nicky. She and Nicky’s protégée were about\\r\\nthe same size, it seemed, and she had a pleasant sense of having been\\r\\ngenerous. They were mostly things that could have been made over for\\r\\nherself. There was a glow of kindliness about her. She even joked a\\r\\nlittle with Lucille, and told her about the clever sandwiches that\\r\\npreceded the dinner at Mrs. Copeland’s. She went upstairs and threw\\r\\nall the windows open to the soft breeze. Things were lovely today. It\\r\\nwould have been a day to play in, but there were no engagements. Well,\\r\\nanyway, she intended to stay at home and mend. Brice had been rather\\r\\npathetic that morning, searching for a shirt with all its buttons. She\\r\\nsmiled at herself indulgently. Good old Brice. She really neglected\\r\\nhim a little, sometimes. She loved to make pretty things; mending was\\r\\nstupid. But this day she would give up to Brice, make up to him a\\r\\nlittle, however secretly, for her moment’s disloyalty at the club the\\r\\nother day. Not that it was really disloyalty. It was nothing worse than\\r\\nsilly, wild talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door-bell sounded. In a moment Lucille came up with a florist’s\\r\\nbox. “Mist’ Denison cert’n’y do think a heap o’ you-all,” said she.\\r\\n“I’m going to git me a husband.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. When the girl had left the room she opened the box.\\r\\nTulips, this time, and Ranney Copeland’s card among them. She arranged\\r\\nthe flowers about the house, smiling a little. Then she went back to\\r\\nher sewing. She sewed on some buttons, and reached for a basket piled\\r\\nhigh with stockings. Mending was stupid work. The curtains blew inward.\\r\\nEveryone would be out on Main Street. She had not telephoned the order\\r\\nfor dinner. It would please Brice if she went to the store herself.\\r\\nThere was no darning-cotton, after all. There never was, when you\\r\\nwanted it. She laughed a little at the eternal elusiveness of things\\r\\nlike darning-cotton, put the basket aside, got into her trimmest street\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had barely turned the corner when a low, brown car swung up to the\\r\\ncurb and stopped just in front of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now don’t tell me you were trying to dodge me,” said Ranney Copeland’s\\r\\ngay voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. “I had forgotten you,” she said, giving him a teasing\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nRanney’s composure was not shaken at that. He had stepped to the\\r\\nsidewalk beside her. “I believe you were coming to meet me,” said he,\\r\\nlaughing with her. “Let me give you a lift, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not in Anne to resist stepping into that car; but when Copeland,\\r\\nat the next corner, turned away from the main street where the shops\\r\\nwere, she protested. “Oh, I mustn’t, Ranney. I’ve an errand--really.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So have I,” he declared, cheerfully. “I’ve got to show you something I\\r\\ncame across the other day. Won’t take a minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the minute prolonged itself into an hour. The car spun out of the\\r\\ntown, climbed a hill or two with no lessening of speed, sped away to\\r\\nthe open country. Good company, was Ranney. After all there was all day\\r\\nfor the mending. It had waited so long that it could very well wait a\\r\\nwhile longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was past noon when at last the car stopped before a little gray\\r\\nroadhouse, once the place where a tollkeeper lived, the old tollgate\\r\\nnow standing upright at one side of the road like a gaunt arm held high\\r\\nin surrender before the exigencies of modern life. Inside, in the tiny\\r\\ndining-room, beside a window that looked into budding apple trees, a\\r\\ntable was prepared for two. At her look Ranney laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You didn’t think I was going to let you stay in that house of yours on\\r\\na day like this, did you?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flushed. “It is the house that I live in,” she said. But her\\r\\nattempt at dignity made no impression upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come now! You hate it, and I thought you’d like this! They give\\r\\nyou chicken and waffles. Not bad.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer lip quivered a little as she sat down. This was it. This was the\\r\\npower she wanted, the power these people had with their magic of\\r\\nmoney. To be able to get away from the little rooms of life, to ignore\\r\\ndistance, to speak a word over the telephone and find things prepared\\r\\nfor you, things, any kind of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a minute or two, and some of those things were there on the table\\r\\nbefore them. When the waitress had left the room, Copeland leaned\\r\\nacross towards Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t mean to be brutal, you know. Honestly, I wanted to give you a\\r\\ngood time. Anne----?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know, Ranney,” she said, a little wearily. “You’re a good friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I want to be,” said he. Presently he added, “Anne, I\\r\\nwonder if you know what you’ve meant to me, these past months.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, Ranney. Sometimes I’m numb. Sometimes I don’t know\\r\\nanything, don’t feel anything.” Why was it that, with him, a sense of\\r\\nutter helplessness against her fate, against the web she was caught\\r\\nin, seemed always to close her in? Twelve hundred, fifteen hundred\\r\\nmore added to Brice’s salary. What, after all, would that little bit\\r\\ngive them? How far would she ever be able to get away from that eternal\\r\\ngrubbiness?\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s been a good deal, Anne. I wish I could tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. Don’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I wish I could. I want to. You’ve been good, letting me see so\\r\\nmuch of you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time she thought of that. A good deal. Yes, it had been\\r\\nthat to herself, too. It had seemed natural enough, yet it was, it had\\r\\nbeen, a good deal. Her eyes widened. She gave him a startled look. “Too\\r\\nmuch, perhaps, Ranney. Perhaps I had better----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come now, Nance! Don’t begin to play the prude, just because the\\r\\nold hens are cackling. You’re too good a sport for that. Don’t you\\r\\nlisten to Alice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was leaning towards her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Anne! Just how much did you really mean of what you said\\r\\nyesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not one word,” she declared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought that. But why not? Why not, after all? Why not make a break\\r\\nfor it? A woman like you can get anything she wants.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer thought flew to Brice. Abruptly it was as though his good old red\\r\\nhead, his bowed shoulders, were there before her instead of young\\r\\nCopeland’s sleek one and his shoulders so carefully tailored.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I have everything I want,” she said, her lips trembling a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed. “I said you were a good sport. But I do want to do\\r\\nsomething for you, Anne. I wish you’d make your husband give me that\\r\\nmoney to invest for him. There’s a good thing I know of, right now.\\r\\nYou’d have a mighty nice turn-over in only a month or two.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned back, and he let her think it out. The morning’s revulsion\\r\\nof feeling was not entirely banished by the hour with Ranney. She was\\r\\nstill feeling Brice, in that subconsciousness where a woman’s thought\\r\\nof her husband is ever present, as the dear old blunderer who must be\\r\\nprotected and cared for. Her mood was still but little different from\\r\\nwhat it had been when she had wanted to mend his stockings and sew on\\r\\nhis buttons. Old Brice--to do something for him--somehow to protect\\r\\nhim from those queer ideas of his, from his inhibitions. That money.\\r\\nIf only he would! Ease for them both. Yes, for Brice as well as for\\r\\nherself. Oh, she knew how he thought about it. He called it gambling.\\r\\nAs if everybody didn’t do it. He said they must have something on hand,\\r\\nsomething always available, in case anything happened. As if men could\\r\\nnot always borrow. He loathed credit accounts, he made himself an\\r\\nobject of gloom over every bill. As though credit were not to be used!\\r\\nBesides, she could be careful. She would be.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ranney,” she said, her face suddenly a little pale, “I will do it. We\\r\\nhave a common account at the bank. I will give you the money to invest\\r\\nfor us. And be very grateful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\nEven more than before she was full of the feeling of wanting to do\\r\\nsomething for Brice. As she stepped out of the tub she remembered that\\r\\nshe had not ordered dinner. She got into a bathrobe and called down to\\r\\nLucille.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No’m, they ain’t any meat,” the girl told her. “I thought maybe\\r\\nyou-all was going out to dinner again, or else you forgot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s good humor held. “You ought to have reminded me, Lucille,” she\\r\\nsaid gently. “But never mind. You just put on your hat and run over to\\r\\nMain Street, won’t you? Get a steak, a good thick one. You’ll have to\\r\\nhurry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes’m, I’ll go. It’s plenty o’ time yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne heard the pleased note in the girl’s voice. Ordinarily, of course,\\r\\nit would be wretched discipline to let her go out except on her regular\\r\\ndays. But this time was exceptional. It was too late for delivery by\\r\\nthe market-man. She went back to her dressing. Fresh things, everything\\r\\nfresh, the prettiest she had, and an old dress he was fond of. She\\r\\nwould make herself beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was all the gentle wife when he returned, all grace, all\\r\\nfragrance. Her consciousness was pervaded by the feeling of having\\r\\ndone something for him, even though he was unaware of it, of having\\r\\nprotected him against himself in the matter of the investment through\\r\\nRanney. She felt motherly towards him, and wifely, too. She would be\\r\\nvery sweet to him, yielding, caressing. She felt that she was quite\\r\\nup to being gay and soothing, as well. As soon as he came in she knew\\r\\nthat there would have to be soothing. He was a little late, and more\\r\\nthan a little frowning. She went at once to the kitchen to have dinner\\r\\nput on the table. She talked about light things, little things. He was\\r\\nunresponsive. When the steak had been served he looked at the hovering\\r\\nmaid and frowned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may wait in the kitchen, Lucille,” he said. As the door to the\\r\\npantry swung to Anne looked at him with raised eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Something has gone wrong. I can see that,” she said, gently. “But you\\r\\ncan’t talk here. She’ll be listening just the same, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice ignored that. “Look here, Anne,” said he. “Mrs. Ogden was on the\\r\\ntrain tonight. Damned chatterer. She told me she saw you driving with\\r\\nCopeland this morning. It’s the second time I’ve had that sort of thing\\r\\nflung at me within the week. I won’t have it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked at him, her eyebrows slightly raised. Two little red spots\\r\\nappeared in her cheeks. She pressed her lips together, touched her foot\\r\\nto the bell under the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Potatoes, Lucille,” she said, quietly. “And remain in the room,\\r\\nplease.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the meal passed in silence. In silence they passed into the\\r\\nliving-room. Brice went for his pipe, was about to speak when the dusky\\r\\nface under the white cap appeared between the curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You-all want any coffee?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No!” snapped Brice; and Anne took a seat by the table under the\\r\\nlamplight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pipe under way, Brice, from the hearth-rug, turned to her. “You\\r\\nheard what I said. I won’t have it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s tongue touched her lips. She was finding her rôle of maternal\\r\\npatience difficult, yet something still remained of that warm\\r\\nprotective feeling. Brice’s furies were soon over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like that man, anyway. I don’t like his confounded\\r\\nimpertinence in trying to get you to give him that money to invest.\\r\\nWhen I have any investments to make I can do it myself. He’s an idler,\\r\\na philanderer. I don’t want you seen with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are speaking of a very good friend of mine, Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he’s not! None of them are. Another thing that Ogden woman\\r\\ntold me. That speech of yours at the country club, all that rot about\\r\\ndivorce. If that’s the sort of thing you’ve got to spout to keep up\\r\\nwith them----!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You needn’t be vulgar!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not as vulgar as they are. Hang it all, Anne, I don’t like these\\r\\nnew friends of yours. They’re not our sort. I don’t like them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean by our sort?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re not in their class. Not financially or any other way. And don’t\\r\\nwant to be. That’s what I mean.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was angry enough now. “Have we got to go over this every night?”\\r\\nshe demanded, standing and facing him. “I tell you, Brice, I am getting\\r\\ntired of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And God knows I am!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no harm in my driving with Ranney. In this year of grace a\\r\\nmarried woman can do as she likes. It’s cheap to be jealous.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t insult you by being jealous of you. You see that, Anne, you\\r\\nmust see that! But I don’t like it. Anne--” his voice shook a little,\\r\\n“Anne, what’s the matter with things the way they used to be?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed, but her eyes did not soften. “Warmed-up meats, and the\\r\\nmovies, and a thrill when somebody gave us a drive in a Ford! Oh, I’m\\r\\nlong past that, Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her. His pipe had gone out, and he lighted it again as\\r\\ncarefully as though he were going through with a ceremony, finally\\r\\nflicking the match behind the gas-log. Anne stooped and took it out\\r\\nagain, deliberately depositing it in the ash-tray on the table. Her\\r\\neyes avoided his. Presently he crossed the room to the desk they\\r\\nshared, the desk where the check-book lay, and in the left-hand\\r\\npigeonholes, Brice’s side, neatly bound together with elastic bands,\\r\\nthe household receipts and bills. The desk was a cheap one. The lid\\r\\nstuck a little, and as he pulled it open a vase toppled over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn--!” he ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing, but picked up the tulips. Then she went to the\\r\\npantry door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lucille, bring a mop and the dust-pan, please,” she said. The tone put\\r\\nBrice hopelessly in the wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bit his lip. He had to wait while the girl gathered the bits of\\r\\nbroken glass and dried the floor. Then he sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked at his back. What had he gone to the desk for? She thought\\r\\nquickly. That check-book. She had not filled in the stub, but the\\r\\ncheck was gone. This was no time tonight, when he was in such a mood.\\r\\nShe watched him covertly, thinking quickly, planning. It was not the\\r\\nfirst time they had quarreled, come to a place where going on seemed\\r\\nimpossible, where both had tacitly agreed to stop, where both had\\r\\nadopted a new manner that dropped a curtain of silence behind them,\\r\\nshutting out the sordidness and the threatening disaster of such a\\r\\nscene as they had just been living through. She found her cue. A change\\r\\nof voice, of attitude, of manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to him, passed a hand lightly over his hair. It cost her\\r\\nsomething to do that, but the price was, after all, paid to herself in\\r\\nself-satisfaction at her magnanimity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re tired. Don’t work tonight. Let’s have a game of cribbage or\\r\\nsomething,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice laid his pipe on the top of the desk--it had gone out again--and\\r\\nreached up for her hand. He raised his head, and his eyes were moist.\\r\\n“You’re a good old girl, Nance!” he said, gruffly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What shall we play?” she asked. “Come along--you’re so tired!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a minute. I took out new life-insurance policy today. Got to write\\r\\nthe check for it. They made me pay high--I’m a bit below par, it seems.\\r\\nNothing to worry about.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNew life-insurance. Then he, too, was counting on that coming increase\\r\\nin salary. But--that check-book.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much--is the premium?” she asked. Her lips felt dry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two hundred.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred, and she had drawn down to less than that. For his sake,\\r\\nall for his sake; and of course they would get it back, “turn it over,”\\r\\nbut--\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brice, don’t write the check tonight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It won’t take a minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brice, I--Brice--you can’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in her voice made him turn again. If it had only been any\\r\\nother night than this, when he was overtired. “Brice, I drew some money\\r\\ntoday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face fell. “How much?” he asked, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Four thousand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat incredulity in his face, that bewilderment. “What do you mean?\\r\\nWhat’s happened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing has happened, my dear, except that I am determined to make you\\r\\ndo the right thing, the sort of thing other men do. You worked hard for\\r\\nthat money, Brice, and you were just keeping it idle there in the bank.\\r\\nI have invested it for you, for us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood up. His face was very white. “Would you mind telling me just\\r\\nwhat you have done?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed a little. “Why, I have told you! You would not do it\\r\\nyourself, so I’ve done it for you. That’s all. We’ll make a quick\\r\\nturn-over with it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have drawn out four thousand dollars?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. And we’ll make money by it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe swallowed, started to speak, swallowed again. “I have taken out a\\r\\nnew policy----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I did not know that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s six hundred due on the house on the first of May. One hundred\\r\\nand eighty-odd in bills. Anne----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll have twelve hundred a year more, maybe fifteen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne! It’s not true! You haven’t drawn out that money! You know I’ve\\r\\nnever been willing to touch it. We’ve saved it little by little. I\\r\\noughtn’t have left it there in the drawing account. Anne!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, where’s your nerve, Brice? You’ll get it all back, and more, ever\\r\\nso much more. Ranney promises that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ranney!” His face flooded with color. “That damned scoundrel! Anne,\\r\\nyou haven’t put that money in his hands? Good God, Anne!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had grasped her wrists. His face was close to hers, a new face,\\r\\nfurious, threatening, outraged, a terrible male face. His grasp hurt\\r\\nher. She felt herself shaking, swept by an anger that was beyond any\\r\\nother anger she had ever known, anger that was dismay, that was shame,\\r\\nand fear, and physical pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne, what’s this man Copeland to you, that he’s able to make you do\\r\\nsuch a thing to me? What’s he to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, she wanted to hurt him, to hurt him. To strike him where it would\\r\\nhurt him most.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just whatever I want him to be!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped her wrists. The moment was eternal, a chaos in which new\\r\\nworlds were forming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much of that talk--at--the--at the country club--did you really\\r\\nmean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you will find that out,” said Anne, “and sooner than you\\r\\nexpect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stared at each other, new people, strange people. His face grew\\r\\ncrimson. A vein stood out in his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will take those words back,” he said, his eyes narrowing. “You\\r\\nwill take those words--back!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not. I mean them, every one of them. I could have Ranney\\r\\nCopeland any moment I wanted him. And if I did take him, it would be no\\r\\nworse than other women do all the time. I can’t go on like this. I tell\\r\\nyou I will not, I will not----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis lips were pressed together. He had become a strange man, with new\\r\\nthings at work, in him, things she had never seen before, things she\\r\\nhad not thought possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right,” he said in a moment. “You shall not go on like\\r\\nthis!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall see Copeland tomorrow. I’ll put an end to it. I promise you\\r\\nthat. The damned scoundrel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean you will ask him for that money?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall not! I tell you, Brice Denison. You’ve shamed me enough,\\r\\ngrubbing along in this hole of a place, making me go without things,\\r\\nmaking me-- O-o-oh! You’re no man!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face grew pale. “And you think Copeland is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know he is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned away, and turned back to her. His hands were shaking, but his\\r\\nface was still. “You will think better of this by tomorrow, Anne.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked back at him from the doorway. “I’ll never think better of\\r\\nit. Never differently, anyway. You’ll see. Oh, you’ll see!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning after her quarrel with Brice she was brought abruptly\\r\\nout of sleep by a sense of disaster, of things shattering and falling\\r\\nabout her. Then she remembered.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had left him downstairs the night before and lain awake for hours\\r\\nbefore he came up. She had pretended to be asleep, had listened to\\r\\nhis quiet movements, at last to his breathing from the bed beside her\\r\\nown. For a long while she lay there awake, knowing that he was awake,\\r\\ntoo, wondering whether he was as tense with anger as she was, whether\\r\\nshe had hurt him enough, hurt him to a realization of his failure, his\\r\\nweakness. She was not sorry she had hurt him. She could have hurt him\\r\\nmore, more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last sleep came; now, when she awoke, it was to find that he had\\r\\ndressed and left the room. A glance at the clock told her that he must\\r\\nalso, long since, have left the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery well. After that crisis of last night it would not be easy to\\r\\ngloss over this quarrel as they had always done before. There had never\\r\\nbeen anything like this. He had misjudged her, set at naught everything\\r\\nshe had done for him. He had scoffed at her friends, behaved utterly\\r\\noutrageously about Ranney Copeland. He intended to shame her further by\\r\\ngetting that money back. Well, he shouldn’t. Anyway, he could not do\\r\\nit at once. Before she and Ranney had parted yesterday there had been\\r\\nwords that came back to her now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne, do you know how much I think of you? Do you, Anne?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had parried that. “I know we’re good friends, Ranney.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had put a hand over hers for an instant. “Friends! Anne, you don’t\\r\\nknow what you’ve been to me, these past months.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You too,” she had murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got to go away tomorrow. Only a few days. When I come back I am\\r\\ngoing to tell you something.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter she had given him the check he had looked at her intently. She\\r\\nhad read things in that look. “You’re not afraid, Anne?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had stepped away from him, laughed a little. “What could I be\\r\\nafraid of--with you, Ranney?” she had asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, she remembered that, now. Yesterday she had been afraid to think\\r\\nof what meaning there might lie in his words, in his manner. Today what\\r\\nstood out was that he would be away for a few days, so Brice could not\\r\\nget the check back at once, not until she had further chance to bring\\r\\nhim to his senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe got up, began to dress. There were small faint marks on her arm\\r\\nwhere Brice’s fingers had pressed, and her anger was fanned to new\\r\\nvigor when she saw them. That she should have had to stand there, held\\r\\nlike that, hurt like that! Like any common fishwife, her husband a\\r\\nbrute, a brawler. To be forced to listen, to look at him. Oh yes, she\\r\\nhad answered him. “Whatever I want him to be!” “I am not going on!” Oh,\\r\\nshe had hurt Brice. She was glad she had hurt him. “I could have Ranney\\r\\nCopeland any moment I wanted him.” She had watched those words sting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could they go on, with those words, stark, between them? She left\\r\\nthe table, went into the living-room. A bit of the broken vase that\\r\\nLucille had overlooked gleamed in the sunlight; she picked it up. The\\r\\npetals of some of the tulips had fallen. A newspaper lay on the rug.\\r\\nThere were matches and burned tobacco on a tray on the table, and a\\r\\nmatch on the floor. The desk was still open. Brice had forgotten his\\r\\npipe. The room wore a dissolute air. It was a place where passion had\\r\\nbroken loose and left its débris. In the cool morning light it looked\\r\\nhaggard. She ran up the stairs to her bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was she to go on? If she and Brice really broke, what would she do?\\r\\nWhat could she do? What did any woman do, unless she married again?\\r\\nWhat else was there? Work? She had no yearnings for work. She knew\\r\\nnothing about it, but all that she wanted to know. She wanted other\\r\\nthings. Life. That was what she wanted so, life. Hadn’t she a right to\\r\\nit?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paced up and down the room, still in its disorder of the night, the\\r\\nsheets thrown back on the beds, Brice’s soiled collar on the bureau,\\r\\nthe dress she had tossed aside drooping over a chair. Intolerable. She\\r\\nwent to a window. Those houses across the street. Stupid people. Oh,\\r\\nwhy wouldn’t Brice see, why wouldn’t he do what other men did? Why,\\r\\nwhy? Oh, hideous, the whole thing, hideous, useless, senseless. That\\r\\nchild across the way on her roller-skates. Such a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she started. Ranney Copeland’s brown car had turned the corner,\\r\\nwas stopping at the curb in front of her house. She drew back, a hand\\r\\nto her cheek. Then he had not gone away. Perhaps Brice had seen him\\r\\nalready. Her face flamed, her heart quickened its beat. She laid a hand\\r\\non the curtain. Then she felt weak. Not Ranney. Not Ranney getting out\\r\\nof the car, but Alice. Alice, running up the cement walk to the steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHastily she looked into the mirror again. Then she went down. The bell\\r\\nhad rung twice. Not like Alice, that haste. Where was Lucille? She\\r\\nopened the door herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice came in. Strange, how anyone as small as Alice could give such an\\r\\neffect of bustling. Anne took in at a glance the clothes she had on,\\r\\nand the haste with which she had donned them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nance! I’m so glad you are home. I’ve come begging.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This room is a sight,” Anne said. “What’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“George is going to Boston, and I want to go with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why on earth don’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the children. You know how I feel about leaving the children\\r\\nalone with the servants. I tried to get Miss Whitney, but she’s out\\r\\non a baby case. Oh, Anne, darling, couldn’t you and Brice stay at the\\r\\nhouse just for two or three nights? I telephoned Nicky, but she’s\\r\\ngetting that miserable girl off somewhere today. You wouldn’t have a\\r\\nthing to do, really. But you know how I feel about the children.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s mind jumped. She and Brice. Two or three nights. She had wanted\\r\\nto get away, anywhere, just for a time until things blew over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be silly, Alice,” she said. “Of course we’d just love to come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You couldn’t come right away, could you? You can telephone Brice from\\r\\nthe house. I’ll drive you over. I’ve got Ranney’s car. He’s away, and\\r\\nGeorge took ours down to have something done to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll have to get a bag, and speak to Lucille.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But hurry, like a love, won’t you? George wants to start early. He’ll\\r\\nprobably be there in a fidget by the time we get back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne went upstairs, for a moment stood in her bedroom with her hands\\r\\npressed to her cheeks. Then she laughed. Oh, this time Fate had played\\r\\ninto her hands! Not Brice. No, not with Brice. She would go, not leave\\r\\nhim a word, but just go. For two nights. Only for two nights. It would\\r\\ngive him a chance to think. Give him time to find out, to cool off, to\\r\\ncome to his senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pulled open a drawer, brought a suitcase from the closet. She would\\r\\nnot need much. Five minutes later she ran down the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must speak to Lucille,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Alice Copeland was already opening the front door. “Oh, you can\\r\\ntelephone from the house,” she said. “You don’t mind, do you? I don’t\\r\\nwant to keep George waiting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they turned the corner Anne looked back. Lucille was standing on the\\r\\nporch, gazing after the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day and the two following, in the Copelands’ house, gave Anne much\\r\\ntime for thinking. The rich restfulness of the house itself, the quiet\\r\\nperfection of food and service, even the bed she slept on, with its\\r\\ndeep box spring and mysteriously soft mattress and embroidered linen,\\r\\nall were as balm to her. For in such a mood as that in which Anne was\\r\\nit is physical things that soothe tense nerves. She did not see much of\\r\\nthe children. With childhood’s prescience they understood well enough\\r\\nthat Aunt Nance was not one who greatly desired their presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had waved farewell to Alice and the impatient George. Alice had\\r\\ncome back three times to kiss the children over again or to leave more\\r\\ndirections with their nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nA New York decorator had “done” Alice’s drawing-room--old Georgian\\r\\npaneling, furniture whose dignity matched it, mellow things that were\\r\\nrestful and beautiful and costly. Things, things that she, Anne, ought\\r\\nto have. Why not? Why had Alice Copeland, and the women like Alice\\r\\nCopeland, a house like this? And why, oh, why, had not Anne Denison one\\r\\nlike it?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drifted upstairs to Alice’s sitting-room. She knew it well, but saw\\r\\nit afresh today. Here were bright printed linens. Almost unconsciously\\r\\nshe computed their cost by the yard. Here were soft chairs, a deep\\r\\ncouch with embroidered pillows, magazines and books, a telephone under\\r\\na lacy French doll. She remembered that she had not spoken to Lucille\\r\\nbefore she left, and crossed to the telephone. But she stopped, the\\r\\nreceiver still on its hook. Why should she? Why, after all, should she\\r\\ngive Brice a clew to where she was? She smiled as the thought came.\\r\\nThis was the last place he would think of her being in, here, domiciled\\r\\nin the Copeland house as its mistress for the time. She wanted to\\r\\npunish him, wanted to worry him, to make him suffer. That was the way\\r\\nto manage him, this time. Had she not tried other ways, at other times,\\r\\nand had it all to go over again? She would let him have time to think,\\r\\ntime to realize what she was to him, time to come to his senses. She\\r\\nraised the receiver, but instead of her own number she gave that of the\\r\\nmarket where she dealt. A roast. He liked the cold-meat régime. Let him\\r\\ntry it. A large roast, that would last for three dinners; for the rest,\\r\\nshe would trust to Lucille’s ingenuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt luncheon she spoke to the maid. “If anyone calls or telephones, you\\r\\nneed not say that I am staying here while Mrs. Copeland is away. It\\r\\nwill not be necessary. You may just make a note of the calls, and we\\r\\nwill give them to Mrs. Copeland when she gets back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThree quiet days, two nights of soft sleep. On Friday Alice returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a darling you’ve been, Nance! The children look splendid,” she\\r\\nsaid, as though she had left them for a month and dreaded to find them\\r\\nsmall shadows of themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed; she was in the mood to laugh easily, well pleased with\\r\\nherself. “But it’s been heavenly,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope Brice didn’t mind. I do hope they made him comfortable.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice. She had not thought of it, but Alice, of course, would discover\\r\\nthat Brice had not been there. “To tell you the truth, dear,” she said,\\r\\n“I didn’t bring Brice. He’s such an old stay-at-home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s face fell. “Oh, my dear, then I shouldn’t have begged you to\\r\\ncome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense. Brice was probably glad to get rid of me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed as she said it, but Alice’s face was still serious. “Of\\r\\ncourse you don’t mean that,” she said. “But just the same, I feel\\r\\nconscience-stricken. You know I’m a perfect goose about leaving the\\r\\nchildren, but I’d rather leave them than be separated from George, even\\r\\nfor a day or two. Silly, isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was mid-afternoon when she drove home. From the car she noticed that\\r\\nthe front window shades were all at different heights. But aside from\\r\\nthat the whole house, even the street itself, struck her as though she\\r\\nhad been away from it for a year. The same, all too precisely the same,\\r\\nwith nothing changed. Yet the details stood out in new aspects, and\\r\\naspects not beautiful. In the haste of her departure she had forgotten\\r\\nher key. A disheveled Lucille, capless, untidy, opened the door for her\\r\\nand stared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne turned and waved to Alice. “Good-by! I’ve had a wonderful time,”\\r\\nshe called out. The car slowly gathered speed and went on down the\\r\\nnarrow street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Lucille! You have not changed for the afternoon, have you?” she\\r\\nsaid, but still smiling a little. She was not going to be severe. They\\r\\nall let themselves go, unless you were right there to stand over them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My land! I thought you-all wasn’t coming back any more,” said the\\r\\ngirl. Anne had started up the stairs. Lucille was following with the\\r\\nsuitcase.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been away with Mrs. Copeland,” said Anne. “Did you and Mr.\\r\\nDenison get along all right? Did the roast come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes’m, it come. Mist’ Denison ain’t been home las’ night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stood still for an instant, went on into her room. She thought\\r\\nquickly. Must carry it off. “Oh, that’s true. I forgot he had to go\\r\\naway. Well, we must have an extra good dinner for him tonight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she ordered by telephone. Tomorrow, really, she would begin to go\\r\\nto the store. Then, alone at last in her own room, she put her things\\r\\nto rights, slept for an hour, dressed herself in her prettiest. She was\\r\\nnot going to plan the coming interview with Brice. Oh, he would be glad\\r\\nenough to see her. Time would have done its work. They had both been\\r\\nrather foolish. After dinner there would be a little pretty penitence\\r\\non her part, embraces on his.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited dinner an hour. Brice did not come. She thought of\\r\\ntelephoning the office, realized that everyone would have gone home.\\r\\nAt last she ate alone. The dinner was good, and her appetite was good.\\r\\nHow childish Brice was. Once or twice she smiled as she visualized his\\r\\ncoming in, the quiet, cautious opening of the door, his fumbling in the\\r\\nhall, her placid self there under the lamp, quite as though nothing\\r\\nunpleasant or unusual had ever passed between them, quite as though\\r\\nthere had been no absence. “Hello, dear! Late, aren’t you?” Yes, she\\r\\nsmiled. She could afford to wait. She knew how to manage Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNine, ten o’clock came, and Brice did not come. Until long past twelve\\r\\nshe sat there, a slowly returning anger mounting within her. So he had\\r\\nnot got over it yet. He was playing her own game. Lucille had said that\\r\\nhe had not come home at all, the night before. Oh, if that was what he\\r\\nwas going to do, all right! All right!\\r\\n\\r\\nYet she lay far into the night, sleepless, angry, restless, thinking.\\r\\nIt was despicable, his turning the tables like this. But she would not\\r\\nworry. He needn’t think she would worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning she was aware of Lucille’s curious eyes. Before noon she\\r\\ntelephoned to the office of Whitten & Company. No, Mr. Denison was not\\r\\nthere. Would the person who answered be so kind as to leave a message\\r\\non his desk, asking him to call up his house when he came in? Then she\\r\\ndressed for the street. On the way to the door she stepped into the\\r\\nkitchen, and said, quite casually:\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the way, Lucille, when Mr. Denison calls up, just say that Mrs.\\r\\nDenison wants to have dinner a little early this evening, will you?” He\\r\\nwould know, from that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon she spent at the country club, went there and back in\\r\\nMrs. Ogden’s car. Gayer than usual, she followed the other women around\\r\\nthe links. She must take some lessons in golf. You weren’t in it,\\r\\nreally, unless you played.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No’m. Ain’t anybody telephoned,” said Lucille, on her return. Then she\\r\\nremembered--Saturday! The office closed early. He would not have gotten\\r\\nher message.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she sat at dinner alone, sat there, not eating. No appetite. But\\r\\nof course, that tea at the club. No other reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday. No Brice. The long day alone. Again she lay awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morrow her anger began to be mixed with sheer fright. This was\\r\\nnot like Brice. Never would Brice go as far as this, just to frighten\\r\\nher, just to get even. Something had happened. By mid-afternoon she\\r\\nrealized that she could not, again, sit alone at that table, wait\\r\\nalone in that room for him. She must know. Yet something of pride,\\r\\npride waiting to turn again into anger, made her want, as it were,\\r\\nto cover her tracks. Foolish--oh, she knew it was foolish. Nothing\\r\\ncould, could have happened. Later she would laugh at her panic. And it\\r\\nmight get into the papers. House telephone numbers could be traced.\\r\\nShe went out to a drugstore, one where she was not known. She had to\\r\\ngather her courage before she could drop a coin into the telephone. The\\r\\npolice-station. No accident reported. The hospitals. Nothing. No use\\r\\ncalling up places in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned against the wall of the booth for a moment before she came\\r\\nout of its fetid air. Brice. Brice. What was it? What was it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nYet it was not until the following day that she found courage enough to\\r\\ndo what she knew must be done. Go to him. That was it. He had always\\r\\nhated to have her go to the office, yet she had been there five or six\\r\\ntimes, knew some of the men there. The meeting would be none the easier\\r\\nwith others around. She would have to make it casual. She could. Just\\r\\nwalk in a little hurriedly. “Sorry to interrupt, my dear, but I wanted\\r\\nto tell you----” and so on. That. Just to see him. Just to show him\\r\\nthat she was willing to take things up where they used to be. She knew\\r\\nshe could count upon Brice to do the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour on the train. The ferry. The short walk. Those doors,\\r\\nwhere Brice went in every day, and the elevator. The outer office. A\\r\\nsmiling nod to the man there. One of the partitioned rooms beyond,\\r\\nthat Brice shared with two or three other men. She put her hand on\\r\\nthe door. How her heart was beating! A tap; then she turned the knob,\\r\\nwent in. Brice’s desk by the window, so oddly free from papers. The men\\r\\nthere looked up. Mr. Farren pushed back his chair, came towards her\\r\\nsmiling, hand out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mighty glad to see you, Mrs. Denison. Hope Denison’s all right?”\\r\\n\\r\\nStill she smiled. But how stiff her face felt! Must not let them see,\\r\\nmust not let them guess. She must think quickly, speak naturally. Not\\r\\nask them, not ask Farren. No, she must not do that. To think quickly.\\r\\nThat was it. To think of the best thing to do, and to smile just enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite all right, thank you. I wonder--I thought--do you suppose I\\r\\ncould see Mr. Whitten for a moment?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was thankful that idea came to her. Thankful she managed to speak\\r\\nthe words, any words. Thankful that her voice sounded enough like her\\r\\nown not to give her away to these men, Brice’s associates for how many\\r\\nyears?\\r\\n\\r\\nAn odd little look came and went in Farren’s eyes. Why was he so brisk,\\r\\nso exceedingly cheery? Why was he embarrassed?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m quite sure you can, Mrs. Denison. Just a moment. I’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the room of the head of the firm. Twice before she had met him,\\r\\nonce here in the office, once at his house when Mrs. Whitten had asked\\r\\nher and Brice to dine. He received her kindly enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you sit down, Mrs. Denison? What can I do for you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down, and he turned in his swivel chair to face her, leaning\\r\\nback with his elbows on its arms, the tips of his fingers together. She\\r\\nknew that Farren had closed the door behind him, that a young woman\\r\\nleft a desk in a corner and followed him out. Suddenly the courage that\\r\\nhad carried her on was not there. It was Brice, Brice she wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Whitten,” she said, “I have come to ask about my husband.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah. Yes. Of course. I am sorry, Mrs. Denison, we are all sorry, that\\r\\nthings have turned out so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is not here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man took up a paper-knife that was on his desk. “Well, of\\r\\ncourse, Mrs. Denison, he has told you that. But we are sorry. I may say\\r\\nthat we are very sorry indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did he mean? She could only look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was really no necessity for his leaving so abruptly. In fact,\\r\\nwe are disappointed that he felt he must do so. Disappointed in him.\\r\\nThese things--ah--happen. No good taking them that way. I am sure that\\r\\nDenison can find a place more--ah--more fitted to his--ah--hum. We gave\\r\\nhim a month, you know, to look about in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Whitten paused. He had the air of having said all there was to say.\\r\\nShe clasped her hands together in her lap to still their trembling,\\r\\nleaned a little towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Whitten,” she said, “will you please tell me just what has\\r\\nhappened? Mr. Denison--my husband--has--has told me very little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes sought the window, came back to her, rested on his hand that\\r\\nfidgeted with the paper cutter. “Well, my dear lady, there is so very\\r\\nlittle to tell. These things happen. There was the question, of course,\\r\\nof filling the place that will be vacant on the first of the month. Our\\r\\nMr. Grant is retiring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The promotion really lay between your husband and Mr. Farren. It is\\r\\nthe policy of our firm to give the more responsible positions to men\\r\\nwho have, so to speak, an interest in the firm. A small thing, but a\\r\\nguarantee of their feeling the responsibility as their own. On the\\r\\nwhole, our choice was for your husband. A few days ago, on Thursday, I\\r\\nthink, we put the matter before him, suggested his taking up a small\\r\\nblock of the company’s stock. We set the amount as low as two thousand\\r\\ndollars.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt her lips grow cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a shock, Mrs. Denison; I may say that it was a real shock,\\r\\nwhen your husband confessed that he had no savings whatever. We had\\r\\nnot--ah--thought him that sort of man. We--hum--expressed ourselves\\r\\naccordingly. I feel we were quite within our rights in doing so. Mr.\\r\\nDenison has received a fair salary here, a very fair salary, and we\\r\\nexpect our men to--ah--to live a little better than within their means.\\r\\nOur firm is a conservative one. Therefore, we expressed ourselves\\r\\naccordingly. Mr. Denison seemed somewhat nervous. Somewhat wrought up,\\r\\nif I may say so. Not like himself. He--ah--he stated that he regretted\\r\\nthe firm’s lack of confidence in him, though I think we had not gone\\r\\nquite so far as to imply that, and suggested that we might care to\\r\\nfill his place here. On the whole, Mrs. Denison, that seemed the best\\r\\nthing to do, since he took it that way, and considering our sincere\\r\\ndisappointment. But we gave him, of course we gave him a month in which\\r\\nto look about. We were exceedingly sorry when he came in the next day\\r\\nand informed us that he had decided to leave at once. Exceedingly\\r\\nsorry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not trembling now. It seemed to her that she had not life\\r\\nenough to tremble, that she was still, still, with life dead within\\r\\nher, a heaviness that weighted her whole body. Yet she stood up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Mr. Whitten,” she said. “You have told me what I wished to\\r\\nknow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held open the door for her. She knew that she was shaking hands with\\r\\nhim, knew that his eyes, really kindly eyes, were upon her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry, Mrs. Denison. Great mistake, great mistake for young\\r\\npeople to live up to their means, beyond them. Great mistake to be\\r\\nhasty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat outer office, the elevator, the street. On Thursday. That was the\\r\\nday after she went to Alice’s. Thursday. Brice had not gone home. At\\r\\na street crossing a bell clanged, and she drew back, feeling her lips\\r\\ngrow cold. An ambulance. Someone must know. There must be someone.\\r\\nAmbrose. But he’d take Brice’s side. If Brice really, really had gone.\\r\\nThere was Nicky.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked on and on. What time did Nicky get home? No matter. She\\r\\ncould wait. Or fill in the time with walking. Then, at last, Nicky’s\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Child!” Nicky cried. “What has happened to you? You look like a ghost!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been--shopping,” said Anne. “I thought, perhaps--tea----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You drop down on that sofa,” said Nicky. “I can do better than tea.\\r\\nYou need it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d rather have tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was conscious of Nicky’s eyes furtively on her, but she talked,\\r\\ntalked of anything. Were the clothes right for that girl? Yes, Alice\\r\\nhad been away. With George. So silly about George. No, the shops had\\r\\nbeen stupid. She hadn’t bought anything. It tired one so, shopping.\\r\\nWhat had Nicky been doing? Had she seen Ambrose?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Saw him last night,” Nicky told her, sipping her tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did he--did he say anything about Brice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. What should he say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing. Only I thought----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Anne, what’s the matter with you? What’s wrong with Brice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing. How absurd you are, Nick.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica put down her teacup, stood before Anne with her hands loosely\\r\\nclasped behind her back. “Anne, you’re going to play the devil with\\r\\nBrice, one of these days,” she said. “You haven’t by any chance done it\\r\\nalready, have you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just because I asked whether Ambrose had said anything about him? You\\r\\ndo go rather far, Nicky, even for you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, all right!” said Nicky, with a shrug. “Going? I’ll be out again\\r\\nsoon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLucille at the door, tousled, her apron soiled. No matter. Just to\\r\\nget up to her room. That horrible feeling of having been tramping the\\r\\nstreets with her soul bare, for anyone to see, to look into. Like that\\r\\ndream that comes to everyone of walking abroad without clothing. Now,\\r\\nquivering, wanting to get away from the light. But there was something\\r\\nshe must think of. Oh, yes. Must not let the girl see things were\\r\\nwrong. Back-door gossip.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lucille, I’ve had dinner,” she called down the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy morning she was braced by that blessing of womankind, the\\r\\ninstinctive demand of preserving appearances at any cost. One must\\r\\nwait. Hold hard and wait. Above all, not think. No, not think. Shut the\\r\\nmind to those thoughts. Shut them out. Wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, as though it were indeed a house of death, she shrank away\\r\\nfrom the door when the postman rang. It was nothing, a bill, an\\r\\nadvertisement of a millinery opening. It was after ten o’clock when a\\r\\nmessenger-boy dropped his wheel at the curb and came running up to the\\r\\ndoor. Lucille brought her the little book to be signed, with its grimy\\r\\nsheet scribbled over with names. Not until the girl had vanished into\\r\\nthe back of the house again did she really look at the letter in her\\r\\nhand. Then her knees trembled, from disappointment or relief. It was\\r\\nonly from Ranney Copeland, his business address in the corner. So he\\r\\nwas back. In a moment she ran a finger under the flap of the envelope.\\r\\nSomething dropped to the floor, but her eyes were on what Ranney had\\r\\nscrawled.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Dear Nance,--Just back, and find this addressed to you in my care.\\r\\n  When your fortune is made, you’ll be getting dozens of these. I\\r\\n  thought it might amuse you to taste the first sample. See you soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Yours,\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                RANNEY.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all. Some business circular, then. How sick she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stooped to the letter that had dropped, turned it over. The\\r\\nhandwriting was Brice’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat becomes of the hours when life stands still? Anne Denison thought\\r\\nof that, afterward, and wondered. At the time, during that day and the\\r\\nnext, there was no thought for Anne, but only feeling. Her world had\\r\\nburst, like an electric bulb, and there was no light. Nothing was real.\\r\\nThe very furniture in her house took on strange shapes, grotesque. The\\r\\nsunlight dazzled her. The dark made her want to cry out and beat it\\r\\naway. She was aware of Lucille’s anxious hovering at times, knew that\\r\\nfood was set before her which she had not ordered and which she did not\\r\\neat. Now and again she read Brice’s letter, then hid it away, locked it\\r\\naway, only to take it out again and read:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Anne, I have been a blind fool. Even when the girl said you had gone\\r\\n  in his car, I couldn’t believe it until I learned that he had left\\r\\n  town. God knows I don’t want to stand in your way. The four thousand,\\r\\n  and what you can get on the equity in the house, will see you through\\r\\n  until you get your divorce. Let it be desertion. I will not contest.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                 BRICE.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually, after a day or two, she began again to think, to reason.\\r\\nIt was all plain enough. Those words she had said when they parted,\\r\\nthe night of the quarrel. “Anything I want him to be” and “Perhaps you\\r\\nwill find that out sooner than you expect.” Her anger, her miserable,\\r\\nchildish anger when she said them, the satisfaction she had had in\\r\\nhurting him. Her leaving the next day for Alice’s, and Alice driving\\r\\nher brother-in-law’s showy car. Lucille on the porch, staring after\\r\\nthem. She could imagine that scene when Brice returned, and what\\r\\nLucille must have told him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, she ain’t come in yet. She went off this mornin’ with Mist’\\r\\nCopeland in the car.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like that. And Brice’s anger at her disregard of his wishes,\\r\\nher apparent flaunting of his command not to be seen again with Ranney\\r\\nCopeland. Her not coming home. She turned hot and cold when she thought\\r\\nof what Brice had been through, that next day, at the office. His\\r\\nshame, when he had had to confess to Mr. Whitten that he had not so\\r\\nmuch in the world as two thousand dollars, the two thousand dollars\\r\\nthat was only half of what she had drawn just the day before to put\\r\\ninto Ranney Copeland’s hands, the two thousand dollars that would\\r\\nhave given him that coveted and well-deserved better position, a real\\r\\nplace in the world. Yes, her not coming home, after that next day of\\r\\nhis. What sort of night had Brice spent? What sort of night, while she\\r\\nslept so dreamlessly in that soft bed of Alice’s? She recalled what Mr.\\r\\nWhitten had told her. On that Thursday Brice had gone back, closed up\\r\\nhis desk, left.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrangely enough, for a long time she could not look at Brice’s bureau.\\r\\nAt last she was as strangely drawn to it, stood before it, touched it\\r\\nand drew away, before she gathered courage enough to open the drawers.\\r\\nA few things, only a few things had he taken. In his closet but one\\r\\nsuit was missing, an old one. Her picture was still on the bureau, that\\r\\npicture she had had taken last year in the gown she had worn to the New\\r\\nYear’s dance. There had been another, of young Anne Warren, that she\\r\\nhad declared absurd, with its hair arranged in that out-of-date way,\\r\\nthat she had made him keep out of sight in the drawer. The frame was\\r\\nthere, empty. She dropped to her knees by the bureau. He had taken\\r\\nthat young Anne Warren, that Anne who had won his heart. Anne Denison,\\r\\nAnne in the ball gown, he had left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually, as the difficulties of the situation made themselves clear\\r\\nto her, she became filled with a cold anger against Brice, an anger far\\r\\ndifferent from the earlier blazing fury. That he should have dared to\\r\\nbelieve that thing of her, that he should have dared to misunderstand\\r\\nher, and put her in this ghastly position. Oh, yes, she had said those\\r\\nbitter things. But she had lived with him ten years. How could he, how\\r\\ncould he! Never in her heart had she been unfaithful, undevoted to him,\\r\\nany more than in her actions. Of course every woman, in those moments\\r\\nof desperate rebellion that the closeness of the marriage bond brings,\\r\\nthinks of what might happen, thinks of what she might do, thinks\\r\\nperhaps of leaving it all. But she had never meant it. No, never,\\r\\nnever! Deliberately she closed her mind to what might have been going\\r\\non in Brice’s mind. She would not let herself think again of what he\\r\\nhad gone through during those days of her unexplained absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not love Ranney Copeland. But she had loved Brice, and this\\r\\nwas what had come of it. Ranney Copeland? How much of truth was there\\r\\nin what she had said to Brice, that she could have Ranney Copeland\\r\\nwhenever she wanted him? She thought of that, shrank away from the\\r\\nthought, grasped at it again. What else was there?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first the world had to be faced, people had to be told, and the\\r\\ntelling must come from herself, if the tale were to wear the guise she\\r\\nwished it to. There came a morning when she telephoned to make sure\\r\\nthat Alice would be at home. An hour later she was in Alice’s upstairs\\r\\nsitting-room, where Mrs. Copeland was remonstrating with one of her\\r\\nsmall daughters who did not wish to go out for a walk. A patient maid\\r\\nwas standing near holding the other child by the hand. The little girl\\r\\nwho was consciously good eyed the one before whom Alice was kneeling\\r\\nwith that stolid understanding of childhood, and with something of the\\r\\ngood little girl’s self-complacency at the iniquity of the naughty one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But--I--am--not--going out with Nelly!” Elizabeth was saying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you are, darling! Come--put your arm in your coat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Put your arm in, darling, for mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t wear this old coat. I’m going to wear my new blue coat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you!” Alice’s voice sounded as though she had just thought\\r\\nof the most wonderful thing. “I’ll tell you! You shall wear your blue\\r\\ncoat the very next time you go out with mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thin arm went into the brown coat. “Well. When am I going out with\\r\\nyou, mother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll drive down to meet daddy this afternoon. There--now kiss me, and\\r\\nrun.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How wonderful you are with them, Alice,” said Anne, a little sadly,\\r\\nwhen the children had left the room. “Where do you get all that\\r\\npatience?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it isn’t patience, really. It’s a sort of trying to meet them on\\r\\ntheir own ground, the poor little darlings. You know how you feel,\\r\\nyourself, sometimes, about doing things you don’t want to do, and\\r\\nwearing things you detest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there really anything you detest, Alice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, yes, of course there is. I don’t think about it very much, but\\r\\nthere must be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you have everything! Just look at this room of yours, at this\\r\\nhouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s face grew serious. “Nance, I wish you would let me say\\r\\nsomething to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know what you want to say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe you do, not really. I don’t minimize the comfort of\\r\\nhaving things, Nance, just because I’ve been one of the fortunate ones\\r\\nthat have always had them. But, honestly, Anne dear, it is not things\\r\\nthat make one’s happiness. I’d be happy anywhere, anyhow, with George\\r\\nand the children. I would. And you have Brice, Nance. He’s such a dear!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain came that ghastly coldness about her lips that she had felt in\\r\\nMr. Whitten’s office. How had Brice dared to make it so difficult\\r\\nfor her? She had to hold hard to that anger against him, had to find\\r\\nsomething to give her courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, Brice. That’s what I’ve come here this morning for, Alice. To\\r\\ntell you, before anyone else. Brice and I have separated.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice stared at her for a moment, then abruptly sat down. Anne moved a\\r\\nstep or two across the room, back again, let herself sink softly into\\r\\na low, deep chair. She thought she had done it well. But why, why, why\\r\\ndid she have to do it at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice had flushed. “Anne Denison! How can you say a thing like that?\\r\\nWhy, Anne!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is quite true. Of course we are not going to make a scandal of it.\\r\\nThere’s a way of doing it decently. Desertion, I believe, or something\\r\\nlike that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long minute Alice Copeland sat there without moving, looking at\\r\\nAnne. Then tears came to her eyes. “Nance! It can’t be too late. Let me\\r\\nsee Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No use, Alice. Brice has already left town. Oh, it’s quite all right,\\r\\nmuch the best thing for us both.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t believe that! It isn’t possible that you can!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, please, Alice dear! It’s all settled, or will be, as soon as the\\r\\nthing can be arranged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But divorce! Anne, you can’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing. Was it all going to be as hard as this?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne! Why, you’d be like that dreadful Callum woman we were talking\\r\\nabout at the country club that day, or like Tessie Ogden. The last time\\r\\nshe married again the day after she got her decree.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why not? It’s quite legal, I believe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Legal! After those promises, and the life together? Oh, Anne!” Alice\\r\\nwas openly sobbing now. Anne did not look at her. Presently she spoke\\r\\nagain. “Anne, there isn’t, there couldn’t be anyone else? Brice isn’t\\r\\nthat sort.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you we’d call it desertion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Anne, Nance darling, think of the loneliness! What would you do,\\r\\nwhat could you do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does any woman do, any woman like me? I don’t know how to earn my\\r\\nown living. I’m not young. I’m not old, either. I want life. Yes, I do,\\r\\nI want life. Well, how does any woman get it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat there a while without speaking, without looking at each other.\\r\\nPresently Alice went to a window and leaned out. “Don’t let them play\\r\\noff the sidewalk, Nelly,” she called.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came back her manner had changed. “You’ve told me your news,\\r\\ndear. I suppose I ought to tell you ours. Or has Ranney already told\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ranney?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His engagement is to be announced at last. I had come to believe it\\r\\nnever would be, but they settled it while he was there. He’s played\\r\\nfast and loose. She’s a nice girl. Too nice for Ranney. He’s so\\r\\ndifferent from George.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light in the room had grown strange. Anne’s lips were cold. She\\r\\nmust keep calm, keep smiling. “Oh, you’re always too hard on Ranney, my\\r\\ndear,” she heard herself saying. “He’s not a bad sort. I rather like\\r\\nRanney. What is the girl’s name?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes later Alice followed her out towards the stairs. “Anne,\\r\\nwait a moment. Forgive me for asking. Have you money enough? Because\\r\\nGeorge and I----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, plenty of money. Plenty. Thanks just the same, dear. You give\\r\\nRanney my love and tell him I’m waiting to hear all about it. I must go\\r\\nnow. Don’t look like that, Alice. I’m all right.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice kissed her. “I can’t bear to think of it,” she said, with a catch\\r\\nin her voice. “Let me try, let George go to him. It can’t be too late.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t, Alice, please, please,” Anne said. She drew away. The world\\r\\nwent black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night she lay looking out at the stars, and thinking. Another\\r\\nnight came back to her when she had watched the stars with Brice, while\\r\\nthey were still in that first new, terrible strangeness of union, of\\r\\nunforeseen distastes, on her part of mute shrinking from contacts and\\r\\nbareness of mind and body which Brice took so naturally and joyously.\\r\\nShe had thought Pelham a strange place for him to choose for their\\r\\nhoneymoon; a place where there was nothing to do, no one to be seen, no\\r\\none to show herself to. The cottage on the bank of the stream, their\\r\\ntiny, too-intimate room with one window, the table where they had their\\r\\nmeals with the old sisters whose sole means of livelihood came from\\r\\nboarding the casual trout-fishermen and more frequent lumbermen--she\\r\\nwould have been restive there, if it had not been for Brice’s adoring.\\r\\nThat she had welcomed. She would yield her hand, her lips, with a\\r\\ngratifying feeling of conferring. At times Brice had taken her gifts\\r\\nhesitantly, worshipfully; at other times tempestuously. The moments\\r\\nof devoutness pleased her more. Even in those early days she had told\\r\\nherself it was that attitude, that state of mind, that she would foster\\r\\nin him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their last evening in the woods it had been Brice who had shown\\r\\nreluctance to leave them. Even in that hour Anne was for going on to\\r\\nthe next thing, the new thing, the thing beyond, unafraid of whatever\\r\\nit might be, purposing always to sway it towards herself, to make it\\r\\nher own. She had never questioned that she could influence and form the\\r\\nnew life they were going into together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Brice had drawn her out of the cottage that evening, and they had\\r\\nwalked along the rutted road, the dark woods treading the hill on their\\r\\nleft, the stream murmuring at the foot of the slope like music heard\\r\\nin a dream. The moon was young and pale, blending its light with the\\r\\nlambency of the stars. They walked through mottled shadows, Brice’s arm\\r\\nabout her. Sometimes as they emerged into an unshadowed place where the\\r\\nmoonlight found her hair his arm would tighten. She would let her head\\r\\nfall back against his shoulder, gratified at his tremor of emotion, at\\r\\nthe sense of power it gave her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came to a place where the road dropped to the level of the stream,\\r\\nwhere a broad rock from which Brice had often fished protruded above\\r\\na pool where trout would rise a few hours later. They stood there\\r\\nside by side. Before the silvery beauty gemmed in the setting of the\\r\\nsurrounding woods Brice’s arm had dropped away. He loved the place.\\r\\nHe had led his love and his emotion to it, and stood with his face\\r\\nupturned to the stars, wrapt, a votary before the altar on which he has\\r\\njust laid his gift. Anne felt the withdrawal of his spirit. She was\\r\\nmore conscious of Brice than of the shimmering water, of the stars.\\r\\nShe was a little teased, amused, impatient at his enraptured, upturned\\r\\nlook. She wanted his return to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear,” she said. “Isn’t it beautiful?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice looked at her. “You are,” he murmured. “You are beautiful. Our\\r\\nlast night here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you glad?” she laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not answer. He did not touch her, did not move. All playfulness\\r\\nand all passion seemed to have left him. He was remote, a being other\\r\\nthan the man who had held and caressed her. She became restive.\\r\\nShe went close to him, brushed against him, raised her face in the\\r\\nmoonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards they sat on the rock until the moon dropped over the hill,\\r\\nand the pool lay dark beneath the shadowing trees, and the stars shone\\r\\non the face of the stream, on Brice and herself. She was satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We ought to go in,” he said. “I ought not to keep you out here in the\\r\\ndampness. You might get chilled.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled to herself, moved her cheek softly against his, yielded\\r\\nherself more to his arms. “This is so sweet,” she whispered. “And we\\r\\nare going away tomorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pressed his lips to her hair, on her closed eyes, while the stars\\r\\nmoved on.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, she would always know how to manage Brice, how to bring him back\\r\\nto consciousness of her! What was instinctive at that early time had\\r\\ngradually developed into a technique that perfected itself as the\\r\\nneed grew for holding him, controlling him. She had believed that she\\r\\nknew Brice’s mind and heart, all his impulses and reactions, just as\\r\\nshe believed she managed them all for his well-being and her own. Her\\r\\nultimate conception of successful marriage was that the woman must\\r\\ndominate, possess, and manage the man; woman’s part was to be the\\r\\nsilent mainspring, man’s the clicking wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow and again during the years she had been aware of that same silent\\r\\nwithdrawal of Brice’s which she had first encountered in Pelham under\\r\\nthe stars. She believed it was only his masculine inarticulateness, or\\r\\nmental indolence, or contentment too absolute to be broken by speech\\r\\nor action. If by chance she suspected herself momentarily forgotten or\\r\\ndisapproved of, she had always known what to do. She could make him see\\r\\nher again as beautiful, admirable, desirable. If it came to argument,\\r\\nshe had always been able to make him say that she was right, or at any\\r\\nrate to yield to her. Only this last time had she failed; and she would\\r\\nnot have failed even then, if Brice had not, in this inexplicable way,\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was the bare, ugly fact. He had disappeared. He had done the\\r\\nutterly unforeseen, and now she was lying in Alice’s house, her body\\r\\nfilled with the dull ache of fever, looking again at the passage of the\\r\\nstars. Tonight the pool was not a peaceful depth above which she rested\\r\\nin Brice’s arms and drew him to thought of her. It was not peaceful. It\\r\\nwas an enveloping blackness, hideously silent, that surged about her\\r\\nand buffeted her about like a leaf in the wind, helpless, rebellious,\\r\\nlonging to rest, longing to find again some firmness of thought that\\r\\neluded, that spun dizzily and mockingly through her brain. She was\\r\\nalone. There was no Brice. It was as though, after ten years, he had\\r\\nabruptly thrown her arms from his neck and sent her into that whirling\\r\\nnight of bewilderment where nothing was as she had known it, nothing\\r\\nwas real.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet after all something was real. What Alice had told her, and the\\r\\nsmiling nurse confirmed. Motherhood. Terrible. A leering joke of Fate,\\r\\nas unexpected, as cruel, as bewildering as Brice’s behavior. For hours\\r\\nshe was benumbed at the knowledge. She felt about it as one feels\\r\\ntowards death. It could not be true, there must be some mistake. Yet as\\r\\nin the case of death, all the while she admitted the inevitableness of\\r\\nit: as death comes surely to all, so had this thing come inescapably to\\r\\nher. She would still have to know, tomorrow, that it was real. For many\\r\\ntomorrows she would have to bear the burden of it, and alone. In time,\\r\\nshe would have to suffer. Alone. There would be a child, and Brice not\\r\\nthere to--to suffer for it. She thought of that, savagely. Oh, Brice\\r\\nshould have suffered for this, as she would have to suffer! It wasn’t\\r\\nfair, wasn’t fair. Even if Brice had been there, it would not have been\\r\\nfair. After ten years, motherhood. She had never wanted children. She\\r\\nknew why other women wanted them, some women. They were hostages to\\r\\na sort of happiness, to complacency, to stability, to the holding of\\r\\ntheir husbands. Oh, yes, to some women, doubtless, something to love\\r\\nand care for, something on which to gratify that sentimentality that\\r\\nshe had always scorned. She had not needed children. She knew how to\\r\\narrange her life without that bother, that clutter, as she knew how to\\r\\nhold Brice. A cry escaped her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse came, bent above her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! I don’t want anything, thank you,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was for the moment true. She would have welcomed oblivion,\\r\\nanything, anything, that would let her escape her shattered world.\\r\\nShe had believed so unquestioningly that she understood Brice, knew\\r\\nhis every thought, how to manage him, how to hold him. And now he had\\r\\ngone. He had deserted her, left her with this. A child. His child. For\\r\\nshe did not think of it as hers. It was Brice who had loved children,\\r\\nwanted one of his own, though she had believed she had convinced him\\r\\nof the inadvisability of having them. How could they have gotten\\r\\nalong with all the added expense of children? But now--! There was no\\r\\npermanency left. All her plans, all her ideas, were whirling about\\r\\nher; only those stars were serene.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes she lay burning with anger which always resolved into\\r\\nbitterness against Brice. He should be found, would be, must be.\\r\\nAnd then--oh, yes!--then she would know what to do. There would be\\r\\nno more of those silent withdrawals of his, no more of his futile\\r\\nrebellions against her will. She had been too soft, too gentle. She had\\r\\nunderestimated his desire and need of pleasing her. Now there would be\\r\\nthe child, a mighty weapon. And she would use it. As other women used\\r\\nit. Brice must be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Nicky who precipitated the affair of the search for him. The\\r\\nnurse was gone at last, leaving Anne still languid in body after the\\r\\nfever and shock, but well enough to go down to Alice’s sitting-room in\\r\\nthe afternoons. She knew that Alice watched her, sensed Alice’s vague\\r\\ndisappointment and was scornfully amused, however secretly. Doubtless\\r\\nAlice expected a softening in her, a rosy tenderness of anticipation,\\r\\nas if any sudden incident could make a person other than she had always\\r\\nbeen. For with returning strength Anne was becoming herself again,\\r\\ncalm, measuring, coolly determined. She was only awaiting the apt\\r\\nmoment for speaking of Brice to Alice and George.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky came in grinning impishly at Anne lying on Alice’s couch, lithe\\r\\nand graceful, well enough aware that the gracefulness would pass,\\r\\nmaking the most of the moment, one arm above her head, the other hand\\r\\nbetween the pages of a magazine she had not been reading.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So the blow has fallen!” Nicky remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nicky, don’t!” cried Alice. “It’s so sweet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, isn’t it? Like all the rest of the bonds of matrimony. How does\\r\\nBrice take it? Solemnly, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do sit down, Nick,” said Anne, and added, “Brice doesn’t know the joy\\r\\nin store for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky sat down, and Alice, her eyes on her sewing, said in a tone which\\r\\nwas meant to carry a warning that the subject was not to be pressed\\r\\nupon, “Brice is away, Nicky dear. What have you been doing lately?”\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica recognized the tone, and laughed aloud. “What’s up?” she\\r\\nasked, looking from Alice to Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, too, looked at Alice, who had flushed a little. “Isn’t she a\\r\\ncherub? Alice--I do love you. The plain truth is, Nicky, that old Brice\\r\\nhas gone off. Thinks he’s left me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Anne dear!” from Alice, beseechingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew there was something queer,” Nicky exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stirred; the arm over her head came down. “Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because Ambrose----”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed, sat up. “Ambrose! Of course! Alice--why didn’t we think\\r\\nof that? Of course, Ambrose knows where he is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, as to what Ambrose knows, or thinks he does,” Nicky exclaimed.\\r\\n“I’ll leave that to you two! All he would tell me was that old Brice\\r\\nwas sick or something. He said Brice wrote him a letter last week, from\\r\\nAlbany or somewhere, and asked him to be good to you, Anne. To stand by\\r\\nyou or something.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From Albany! But that couldn’t have been all,” Alice cried. “He must\\r\\nhave said more than that!” Anne’s eyes narrowed a little; she was\\r\\nthinking intently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All Ambrose told me. But he’s worried about it. Tried to call up your\\r\\nhouse, Anne. And went down to Whitten’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne nodded. “Yes. I went there, too. Before I came to see Alice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky chattered a moment or two of other things, looked at her\\r\\nwrist-watch and said she must fly. Alice went out of the room with her.\\r\\nWhen she came back, she sat down by Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Darling, I think Nicky came to say that. What did she mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve wanted to tell you, Alice. It--isn’t easy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do think you had better. George could help, I am sure, if we knew.\\r\\nWhat was that about Whitten’s?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It goes back to the time I came here to look after the children. We\\r\\nhad quarreled, and I did not leave word for Brice where I had gone.\\r\\nHe--thought things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! But he couldn’t! Not that, Anne!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Apparently he did, though. He left me a note. I told you he had\\r\\nsettled things. He thought he had. By telling me I might divorce him.\\r\\nHe even left Whitten’s. Gave up his job. What he told Ambrose only\\r\\ngoes to prove how determined he was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! But now----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. That’s just it. Now there is--this. Brice will have to know this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew George could help! He will find Brice, dear. And then--oh,\\r\\nyou’re going to be happy, so happy, so happy, Nance! You and Brice--and\\r\\nwhat’s coming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled, content for the time to leave it there. She was still\\r\\nweighted with that unaccustomed lassitude, and she knew George would\\r\\nact. Gradually she was able to be about the house again, and at last,\\r\\none evening, George brought Ambrose with him for dinner. Anne sensed a\\r\\ncrisis, and was gay throughout the meal. Afterwards she faced the two\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” she asked. “Out with it, George. What makes you and\\r\\nAmbrose so solemn? You have heard from Brice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know I always said you’d play the devil sooner or later, Anne,”\\r\\nAmbrose remarked. “Looks like you’d done it now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that what you came here to say?” Anne flashed at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. I came to say I have been up to Albany myself. Brice stopped there\\r\\novernight. Had only a suitcase with him. From there he apparently\\r\\njumped off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, jumped off? If you think Brice is the sort of man\\r\\nwho would----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I know Brice better than you ever did,” Ambrose said,\\r\\nsavagely. “God--I hate to see his life ripped up like this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice protested, “Ambrose!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, damn it, I do! It’s my opinion Brice stood things as long as he\\r\\ncould, and got out. I don’t blame him. But I do hate to see it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are implying that it is my fault,” Anne said. “I have never done\\r\\nanything, anything, that would justify Brice’s leaving me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please, please don’t quarrel,” Alice said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no intention of quarreling with anybody,” said Anne. “I never\\r\\nquarrel. I am very much obliged to Ambrose for going to Albany. I\\r\\nshould think you would all understand that I want Brice to come back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know what cost him his job with Whitten,” said Ambrose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s head went up. “I did that for the best,” she said. “If Brice\\r\\nhad waited for me to explain it to him, he would have seen that. When\\r\\nhe comes back, he will agree with me.” Suddenly she looked at George,\\r\\nthrew out her hands in a gesture of appeal. “George, you’ll find him,\\r\\nwon’t you? Oh, don’t you see? I want him to come back!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbrose turned away impatiently, but George said, “Of course you do,\\r\\nAnne. We all do. And as for finding him, why, a man can’t absolutely\\r\\ndisappear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, George,” Alice interjected, “I don’t know. There was that poor\\r\\ngirl who started across the park with a book and box of candy. She was\\r\\nnever heard from.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense, Allie! We’ll have Brice home again in a day or two. In a\\r\\nweek, at latest. Don’t lose your nerve, Anne.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not going to lose my nerve. I know what Alice is thinking. But it\\r\\nisn’t true. Brice is not dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re right, in that,” said Ambrose. “He’s no coward.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think we should take every possibility into consideration,” ventured\\r\\nGeorge. “Not that I----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you are thinking about is not a possibility,” Anne affirmed.\\r\\n“I’ve told Alice that he sent me a letter, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge nodded, but Ambrose looked at Anne, frowning. “Let me tell you,\\r\\nAnne, that you will not help us find Brice by keeping anything back,”\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not keeping anything back. I said I had told Alice. I’m willing to\\r\\ntell you. He wrote to me. I got the letter several days after he was\\r\\ngone, but he had posted it in New York. He told me to divorce him. For\\r\\ndesertion. He said he would not contest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbrose bit his lip, walked restlessly about the room. After a\\r\\nmoment Copeland said, “I feel that you ought to know, Anne, what the\\r\\ndetectives said. They believe there is only one way of finding Brice.\\r\\nTo advertise, to make the thing public.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne paled. Her hand went to her mouth. “Not that!” she gasped. “I\\r\\ncouldn’t stand that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbrose wheeled towards them. “No. Anne’s right. Not that!” said he.\\r\\n“Brice never in his life made a move without thinking it through first.\\r\\nHe has gone. Therefore, he wanted to go. Neither Anne nor you nor I\\r\\nhave the right to force him back against his will. Oh, I know what\\r\\nyou’re thinking of, Alice! But if Brice wanted to cut out his old life,\\r\\nhe knew what he was doing. I say, let the thing drop. Take Brice’s\\r\\ndecision. You’ve no right to do anything else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not considering Anne, nor the child that’s coming, Ambrose,”\\r\\nGeorge said, mildly. “We’ll find Brice. There’s no question of that.\\r\\nBut of course if Anne doesn’t wish it, there shall be no publicity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I couldn’t stand it, George,” said Anne, and Alice added, “Of course\\r\\nnot. It’s not to be thought of.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA week passed, two weeks, and still there was no word of Brice.\\r\\nSomething kept Anne from asking, but her nervousness grew, and she\\r\\nwatched Alice and George, unfailingly kind, and to her awakening\\r\\nsensitiveness increasingly anxious. Her strength had returned, but\\r\\nnot her old vigor. She was beginning to feel it impossible to accept\\r\\nAlice’s hospitality much longer, yet the idea of returning to that\\r\\nempty house was curiously repugnant. It was not the old repugnance\\r\\ntowards its smallness and cheapness. It would remind her so of those\\r\\nlast days there when Brice’s staying away had for the first time given\\r\\nher a doubt of her own power and rightness. She did not want to live\\r\\nthrough days like those again, nor nights like those. The memory of\\r\\nthem gave her an actual quivering of the flesh. She knew that Alice\\r\\nwatched her, and turned her face away when Alice’s eyes would meet her\\r\\nown. One morning she grasped her courage and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not tell me, Alice?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s eyes filled with tears. “Darling, it’s so dreadful,” she said.\\r\\n“We haven’t heard a word. George has had two detectives. They haven’t\\r\\na trace of him, after Albany. George is a director of the bank. He has\\r\\nfound out that Brice took almost no money with him. It’s so dreadful!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s mood alternated between anger and panic. What should she do,\\r\\nwhat could she do, if Brice were not found? How did he dare to remain\\r\\naway? How did he dare, after those years together, to doubt her to the\\r\\npoint of behaving so unprecedentedly?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until an afternoon when Tessie Ogden came in, unannounced,\\r\\nthat the pride was born which was to become a force more impelling than\\r\\nanger or panic. Until that day she had succeeded in eluding all of\\r\\nAlice’s guests; but Tessie came into the upstairs sitting-room without\\r\\nwarning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you poor, poor darling!” was Mrs. Ogden’s greeting. Anne had to\\r\\nendure the embrace that followed, listen to words that her own coolness\\r\\nhad no power of stemming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Men, these men! I’ve had my experience, my dear! You can’t tell me\\r\\nanything about it. It’s just the way my first husband treated me.\\r\\nSimply went off with another woman, my dear. So what was I to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth are you talking about, Tessie? Why the confidence?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t pretend with me, Nance darling. I know all about it. I\\r\\nsympathize. How I sympathize!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand. There is nothing for you to know, except that I\\r\\nhave been rather ill, while my husband is away on business.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Ogden laughed, touched Anne’s hand playfully. “Your Lucille works\\r\\nfor me, now. Needs training, of course, but--! It’s really touching,\\r\\nher devotion to you, her indignation at the way you were treated!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why get your news from a servant, Tessie? What is it worth, from such\\r\\na source?”\\r\\n\\r\\nTessie leaned back in her chair, lighted a cigarette, smiled languidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next afternoon, when Alice was out, Anne left the house and walked\\r\\nto the terraced side-street that she had not seen for weeks. A faint\\r\\nnostalgia gripped at her throat, not for Brice, not for the house nor\\r\\nthe things in it, but for the security that had slipped away from her.\\r\\nShe had even more distaste than before for the street and the house,\\r\\nbut at least it had represented an established place in the world,\\r\\nhowever small, however undesirable. She could never live there again,\\r\\nyet she was seeking it out in an unformulated desire to snatch at some\\r\\nof that lost security. The little girl who used to run to meet Brice\\r\\ncalled to her, swirled up on roller skates. The laundryman’s wagon was\\r\\nat the curb beyond. The grass on her own plot was long, bits of paper\\r\\nand string caught in it. On the porch a yellowed newspaper had blown\\r\\ninto a corner. A folded circular was stuck between the knob and the\\r\\ndoor. She took out her latch-key. How close the hall was!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an oblong of white on the rug, where it had dropped through\\r\\nthe letter-slot. She grew dizzy, grasped at the door for support.\\r\\nBrice.... Why had they not known he would write?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe picked up the letter without turning it over. She could not yet\\r\\nlook at his writing. She went blindly into the living-room. The window\\r\\nshades were at uneven heights. Not his chair. The sofa. Her hat was so\\r\\nheavy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she turned the letter in her hand. It was not from Brice. Miss\\r\\nWilly’s handwriting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from the highways, a hundred miles, two hundred miles inland from\\r\\nthe coast, there are many scattered villages, many road-strung hamlets\\r\\nlike Heathville, some in the valleys, some daring the hill-tops, some\\r\\nclustered about an ancient mill now falling to ruin or transformed to\\r\\nsome more placid use. It may be that over the rutted, narrow roads\\r\\nstage coaches once swirled by on the way to Albany, disgorging their\\r\\ntired travelers at the largest house whose size alone now proclaims its\\r\\nearlier uses. It may be that people built other houses near the tavern\\r\\nin human gregariousness, longing to feel themselves in touch with the\\r\\nworld of affairs. There are other roads over which stage coaches never\\r\\npassed. They remained for the conquest of the rural-delivery mail\\r\\ncarrier. There are a few that even the mail carrier does not attempt,\\r\\nthat climb and wind and drop to wind again for miles between house and\\r\\nhouse. Always where those roads begin there stands a row of wooden\\r\\nor metal boxes set on posts of varying height, storm-bent to varying\\r\\nangles, where the postman stops. The row of boxes and the postman’s\\r\\nautomobile are to the people who live along that road what stage coach\\r\\nand tavern were to their progenitors--their link with the world of\\r\\naffairs. Otherwise life goes on for them with much the same unbroken\\r\\nround as through two centuries. Birth and death, toil and Sunday rest.\\r\\nGoodnesses, evil. A few fields wrung from the grip of granite, a few\\r\\ngrowing back to underbrush. Sun and blight, good crops and failures.\\r\\nNew shingles on a roof here, a new grave yonder. In every village there\\r\\nis a church, in every one a schoolhouse with a flagpole in front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road to Heathville begins at a railroad station where a train\\r\\nfrom the south stops once a day, not to be outrivaled by the train\\r\\nfrom the north. As though disdaining things as modern as railways,\\r\\nit rises hurriedly from the station, crosses a bridge and runs for a\\r\\nmile or two along a crest of red sandstone; then it takes its own way\\r\\nup hill and down, beside a tumbling stream winding through fern-sweet\\r\\nwoods, past fields where willow and hazel tread along the brooks, past\\r\\nrocky pastures where cattle wear their paths among cedars and laurel\\r\\nand blueberries to graze on the rough thatch of grass between granite\\r\\noutcroppings. At last it emerges into a country gentler because it has\\r\\nsubmitted to the hand of man. Orchards and great red barns come closer\\r\\ntogether. Finally, on the summit of the last rocky lift, a white church\\r\\nsteeple points towards the gilded cock that sways to the wind and looks\\r\\ndown upon a dozen houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne arrived there at the hour when dusk had faded into night, a\\r\\nkindly curtain softly dropped between her and the life she had left;\\r\\nkindly, as though to blot distress out of her unhappy consciousness;\\r\\nand softly, as though to indicate the measure of the life that was\\r\\nwaiting for her in the weeks and years to come. But she was not\\r\\naware of the dropping of the curtain; she had no sense of being the\\r\\nspectator at a play. The drama, or the tragedy, was of herself. What\\r\\nhad been and what was still to come was all that mattered to her. The\\r\\npeople in the train, those she had left behind, those she might meet\\r\\nin Heathville, all were no more than settings of her stage. There\\r\\nwas no other stage than hers, no other play than this mad misery of\\r\\nwhich she was the victim, this sequence of events which had caught\\r\\nher up and was carrying her along with it. Yet as at a play, Anne\\r\\nhad a sense of definite divisions of time. One act was over. Now she\\r\\nwas going through another. Again there should be action, directed by\\r\\nherself, staged by herself, brought to some conclusion of her own\\r\\ncontriving. For the time being she was trapped. For months, perhaps\\r\\nfor a year, the best she could do would be to escape those irritating\\r\\ncontacts, to wait with endurance if not with patience, until she should\\r\\nbe physically free again. Looking forward, she had no intention of\\r\\nremaining in the trap forever. What if Brice were not found? What if\\r\\nshe had indeed failed with him? What if their marriage were wrecked\\r\\nforever? Once past this miserable bondage of the body, would not her\\r\\ncourage and her intention reassert themselves, and her pride? Had those\\r\\never failed her? Could one lose, or drop like a garment, all one’s\\r\\ncharacteristics, merely because one had been mistaken and found one’s\\r\\nself involved in an unwelcome human commonplace like the one awaiting\\r\\nher? This child--of course one became fond of her own child. But she\\r\\nwas not of the maternal type, not the sort of woman who would lose her\\r\\nidentity in becoming a mother. The child, if it lived--perhaps it would\\r\\nnot!--should be properly loved and cared for. Of course, there would be\\r\\nits future to think about. There would be difficulties there, if Brice\\r\\ndid not come back. But if he did--ah, he would admit, then, how right\\r\\nshe had always been in her ambitions. Yet for the present there was\\r\\nthis slow-dragging time ahead. By that, and by the uncertainty about\\r\\nBrice, she was trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Nicky had approved of her journey. The thought of it came to Anne\\r\\non the day she found Miss Willy’s letter; her plan matured quickly,\\r\\ninevitably.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Nance dear,” Alice protested. “You can’t go away, not with all\\r\\nthis uncertainty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The uncertainty is worse here, Alice, than it will be there. No one\\r\\nknows me there, except Willy. No one will be watching and speculating.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all in the room when she told of her plan, Nicky and Ambrose\\r\\nand the Copelands. George Copeland, large and shy, told her:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s plenty of room here, Anne. Like to have you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know you would, George. But don’t you see? I’ve got to get away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky gave Ambrose a look. Anne understood. They had been talking it\\r\\nover between them, probably quarreling, as always.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne has the right to do what she wants,” Nicky declared. “Brice\\r\\nseems to have done it. Don’t get sentimental about it, George, nor you\\r\\neither, Alice. Anne doesn’t want sympathy, nor a soft bed to lie on.\\r\\nWhat she wants now is to get away. Don’t you see that? To get away. It\\r\\nstrikes me as perfectly natural.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice said nothing. Her eyes rested softly on Anne. Oddly enough, it\\r\\nwas Ambrose who made Anne’s way clear for her. The house could be\\r\\nrented. It would bring sixty, perhaps seventy dollars a month, half\\r\\nto be held as interest on the mortgage, and something, of course, for\\r\\nupkeep. There was the money that Ranney Copeland had. George could\\r\\nsee to that, properly reinvest it. There would be an assured income,\\r\\nminute, to be sure, but something.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the train Anne thought of her last words with Nicky. “How did you\\r\\nknow?” she had asked, when they had a moment together alone, before\\r\\nparting. “How could you know I wanted to get away?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Doesn’t everyone?” Nicky returned, with a shrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never did, before. I wanted to go on into things, not away. Now I\\r\\nwant to get away from everything, from myself and everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky gave her a look in which mockery lurked. “Oh, well, as to that!\\r\\nGood luck to you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the last two hours on the train Anne’s thought blurred like the\\r\\npassing landscape. She saw the river, the villages and hills, the woods\\r\\nand fields. She sensed the past, believed she sensed the future. The\\r\\ntrain was an overheated, rumbling discomfort that had to be endured,\\r\\nand the country it bore her through mattered nothing. Her own physical\\r\\nlassitude reacted upon her mind until both past and future were lost\\r\\nin her miserable realization of the physical. At last the name of her\\r\\nstation was called. She looked about her on the dark platform, and\\r\\nalmost immediately was aware of the quaint, small person talking as\\r\\nshe came. She had forgotten how tiny Miss Willy was, and how intensely\\r\\nherself, whatever the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Annie, dear child! To think of your coming to see me at last! My\\r\\nbeet-greens are up--your dear father used to love them so. I remember\\r\\nyou didn’t, though. I’ve brought an automobile. It’s Mr. Wilkinson’s.\\r\\nHe’s careful, real careful. Where’s your trunk, child? I knew you’d be\\r\\nused to riding in them, coming from the city and all. All those things\\r\\nyours? My, but you must have a lot of clothes. Still, I dare say you’d\\r\\nneed ’em. Living like you do. No, I can get in alone. Let me look at\\r\\nyou! My, but you’re pale, child. You ain’t sick are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was Miss Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how is dear Brice?” asked Miss Willy, before they were out of the\\r\\ntown. “So handsome! I knew he would take good care of you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to know how you are,” Anne evaded. “I’ll talk about Brice\\r\\ntomorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m well. I’m always well. I can do a day’s work yet, and not have\\r\\nto thank anybody to help me. Why, what do you think, child? Somebody\\r\\ncalled me an old lady, only the other day. Or maybe a few months ago.\\r\\nSeems like the other day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not old,” Anne said, putting her hand over Miss Willy’s. Cotton\\r\\ngloves, the finger-tips long, too long. Knuckles, work-worn, bony,\\r\\nenlarged. Cotton gloves. Age. She shivered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I just guess I am not,” said Miss Willy. “I’m only just\\r\\nseventy-two. That’s not ninety-two, is it? No, nor eighty-two. Oh, I\\r\\ncan do a day’s work yet!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car lurched on, the chatter continued. Anne caught bits of it as\\r\\nshe caught glimpses of woods and fields under the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The day you were married. So sweetly innocent. All in white. I\\r\\ncouldn’t help crying. Going off with the man of your heart. So\\r\\nhandsome. Woman’s lot in life. Life is hard for some. Not that I\\r\\nmean--good gracious, no! Dear Brice! So good of him to let you come to\\r\\nsee me. Good of him to spare you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn and on it went, on and on. Her childhood--like that, on and on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Each day brings it own troubles. Not that I mean--no, of course not.\\r\\nBut sufficient unto the day--_you_ know. Annie dear--_you_ know!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Yes, of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you weren’t listening. It’s pretty scenery, here in the\\r\\nglen. Too dark now to see. But you will see it. You’re going to stay a\\r\\nwhile, ain’t you? Annie, ain’t you going to stay a while? Come so far\\r\\nand all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I’m going to stay--a while.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear Brice. So good of him to let you come. I guess he thought you\\r\\nneeded the change. It’s wonderful the way a man will do everything\\r\\nfor one he loves. So romantic. Like Mazeppa. Or Hero and that\\r\\nwhat’s-his-name--the one that swam the river.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leander--wasn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leander. Yes. Pa had a horse once named Leander. Sorrel. But I’m sure\\r\\nI wouldn’t want anybody to risk his life swimming a river or anything\\r\\nfor me. Human life--the breath of the Almighty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was she saying? Was it really as bewildering as it sounded, or was\\r\\nAnne’s own mind chaotic? It didn’t matter. She heard herself answering\\r\\nagain. “Not a river, was it? A strait.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the same thing. Salt water. And whales. Most uncomfortable, I\\r\\nshould think. Night air’s always damp. Especially if the weather’s\\r\\ncold. That reminds me. I do hope Dorilliam won’t leave the milk before\\r\\nwe get there. It’ll sour before morning, if he does.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the chatter ceased. The car made an abrupt turn. Miss Willy\\r\\ngrasped Anne’s arm as it veered. A small house loomed in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid to leave the lamp burning,” Miss Willy said. “You wait\\r\\noutside, child, while I strike a light.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe milk was on the doorstep, and a large black cat that Anne trod on\\r\\nin the dark. Her bags were set inside at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The kitchen’s no place to bring you into,” said Miss Willy, “but I got\\r\\nto see to the milk.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sank into a rocking-chair, closed her eyes. In a moment Miss Willy\\r\\nwas back. “My goodness, you’re pale as an appagotion!” she cried. “I’ll\\r\\nget you some tea. ’Twon’t take a minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe talked while she busied herself. At the table, the cat jumped into\\r\\nher lap. “Poor Buster! Poor little Buster! The lady didn’t mean to\\r\\nwalk on his tail. Auntie’s baby! Ain’t he handsome, Annie? Is your tea\\r\\nright?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You always had a black cat,” Anne said. Willy’s voice, the jumble\\r\\nof her words. Long ago, childhood, strangely mixed with the present.\\r\\nWhat--what--oh, that languor, that heaviness, and the chatter going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I call myself his auntie. Cats are so sensitive. He’d feel dreadfully\\r\\nhurt, Buster would, if he suspected he wasn’t a member of the family. I\\r\\nnever was married. I don’t like to say I’m--but he knows as much as a\\r\\nchild. You’ll see, Anne, he knows just as much as a child.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat kitchen. Sounds going on and on. Later, the narrow dark hall and\\r\\nthe straight flight of stairs, the bedroom above, the bed. Longing for\\r\\nrest, for cool sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you sleep as late as you can,” said Miss Willy. “You just make\\r\\nyourself right at home here. To think of your coming to see me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep. This low-ceilinged room her refuge. Sounds outside, perhaps only\\r\\ninsects, but like a lawn-mower, clicking, rattling, whirling. They\\r\\nreminded her of too much. Of people on porches, of Brice, walking,\\r\\nwalking behind a lawn-mower, of things she wanted to shut out of her\\r\\nmemory forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet that night she slept soundly and without dreams. She awoke slowly\\r\\nto realization of where she was. A band of sunlight lay on the floor,\\r\\nand through the open windows came the soft sounds of earliest summer,\\r\\nbirds, and a low humming that she could not place. Far off, someone was\\r\\nwhistling. She had not wound her watch. She went to the window, but to\\r\\nher eyes there was no beauty. The loveliness of the rolling hills, the\\r\\nfreshly green pastures and orchards, the little garden below with its\\r\\nneat rows of vegetables already proclaiming old Willy’s diligence--this\\r\\nwas only the country. Always she had thought of the country as of\\r\\na place where lives were rough and barren of enjoyment, crude, as\\r\\nnecessary to the maintenance of man as were mills, but as far beyond\\r\\nher interest as the manufacture of soap. The morning was warm, but\\r\\nshe shivered. To be here, in this emptiness! That church up the road;\\r\\nacross the way the gray house with an ell, and the few other houses\\r\\nbeyond--what sort of people could live in those houses, center their\\r\\nlives about that bare church? Bare--yes, that was it; she had come to\\r\\nthis bareness, to hide. To hide; but not to remain. Impossible, that.\\r\\nTime would pass, the long dragging months. Meanwhile, she would have to\\r\\nmake things as easy as possible. Willy was happy at having her. Willy\\r\\nwas kind and willing, devoted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I let you get your sleep out,” Miss Willy said, beaming, when at last\\r\\nAnne went down to the kitchen. “I always say there’s nothing like\\r\\nsleep for the young. As for me, I like to get up in the morning, so’s\\r\\nto get my chores out of the way. My, you look pretty!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne breakfasted at the kitchen table, the cat Buster staring up at her\\r\\nwith yellow eyes and Miss Willy talking the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Auntie’s boy was naughty this morning. He caught a poor, poor little\\r\\nrobin. Come out to the porch, Annie-my-dear. I’ll show you the nest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt no interest in nests, nor in the wide-opened beaks that arose\\r\\nfrom the one in the grapevine, but it was easier to follow old Willy\\r\\nthan to remain indoors. Alone, she would have to think. The garden was\\r\\na tangled, blossomy place, iris and peonies massed in bloom, roses\\r\\nbudding; bees hummed there, a cat-bird called.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The flowers take care of themselves,” said Miss Willy. “Funny how the\\r\\nLord seems to be able to trust things that are only meant for looks to\\r\\ntake care of themselves, while what’s meant for use has to give us a\\r\\nlot of hard work and all. I want you should see my vegetables.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey passed a row of flaunting rhubarb. A cooped hen beat back and\\r\\nforth behind slats because her chicks were rambling and scratching\\r\\nunder the broad leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, look at my beet-greens. And the radishes. They’re not quite\\r\\nready. I got the peas in good and early. Ain’t it a handsome sight?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had to say something; the small bright-eyed face was expectant.\\r\\n“Wonderful! Who does it all for you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy laughed. “I just knew you’d ask that. Nobody does it but me.\\r\\nNot a soul helps me. I just guess I can do my day’s work yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, Willy, you don’t plant and dig. You can’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little head tossed. “Oh, don’t I? It’s my garden. I do it all.\\r\\nWell”--she gave Anne a fleeting look--“well--all but the spading.\\r\\nDorilliam does that. I don’t want to take praise for what I don’t\\r\\ndo. And--my gracious!--that reminds me! I ought to’ve gone over this\\r\\nmorning and had him drive down for your trunk. Now I can’t get him till\\r\\nnoon. You did bring a trunk, didn’t you? You going to stay a while?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Anne felt dizzy. “Can’t we go back to the house?” she asked.\\r\\n“Can’t we go in? I must tell you----”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the cool kitchen Anne told her. Miss Willy sat upright, sometimes\\r\\nher eyes on Anne’s face, sometimes on the hands folded tightly together\\r\\non her apron. She asked no question, made no comment. When Anne had\\r\\nstopped speaking she sat for another moment silent; her lips twitched a\\r\\nlittle. Then she said, not looking at Anne:\\r\\n\\r\\n“And to think it was me you came to. I--I’ve always wanted a baby to\\r\\nhold all I’d a mind to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne pressed her hands to her cheeks, started to speak again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t talk any more, if I were you,” said Miss Willy. “I can see\\r\\nyou been through a lot. Talking won’t help it. You’ll feel different,\\r\\nafter the baby comes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah--different! I hope so. But the baby is such a small part of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No it ain’t, either. You’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose there is always a way out of everything,” Anne said, from\\r\\nher mood of utter weariness. “We may both die.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy stood up. “Now look here, Anne Warren! I’m glad you come to\\r\\nmy house. I’m glad to have you here. I want you should stay. But it’s\\r\\nmy house, and there’s one thing I won’t have in my house. I won’t have\\r\\nthe Lord’s ways blasphemed nor questioned.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne flushed. “I can go, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you won’t go. You’ll stay where you be. But you’ll use what\\r\\nsense you got while you’re doing it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Willy----!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean it. And I’ll say whatever I’ve a mind to. There ain’t anybody\\r\\nelse to do it, and I knew you when you were a child. You were a little\\r\\ncantankerous imp, all the time wanting your own way, no matter what\\r\\nit might lead to. Many’s the time I longed to turn you over my knee.\\r\\nMany’s the time I wondered whether Solomon didn’t know better than\\r\\nfolks nowadays, when he said that about sparing the rod. Still and all,\\r\\na man with as many wives as he had must have been tried beyond patience\\r\\nwhen it come to the children. So I never laid hands on you, more’s\\r\\nthe pity, and you’re past spanking, now. But you’ll stay here and act\\r\\nsensible. And you won’t talk about dying. That’s in the Lord’s hands,\\r\\nnot yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stood up. How weary she was, how spent. How futile and foolish old\\r\\nWilly, with her primitive talk. That to go on for months. Yet after her\\r\\nwaiting was over there would be other months. “Dear old Willy, you are\\r\\nkind. I want to stay here for a time, until--afterwards. I can pay a\\r\\nlittle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well then, so you shall,” said Miss Willy. “It’s a grand thing, to\\r\\nfeel independent. Like me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe days were long, but she dreaded the fall of evening, when the\\r\\ninsects began their rattling song. There were letters from Alice. Twice\\r\\nAmbrose wrote, inclosing the monthly check. There was no word of Brice.\\r\\nOn that subject Ambrose wrote only a line each time. Alice recounted in\\r\\ndetail, from which Anne’s mind shrank away, his endeavors and George’s.\\r\\nWhat it all summed up to was that Brice had vanished. And the crickets\\r\\nand locusts clicked on, like lawn-mowers. George still wished for\\r\\npublicity, but to that Anne refused her consent. She could see those\\r\\nheadlines, or the veiled salaciousness of those small surreptitious\\r\\nparagraphs in the column marked “Personal.” Her affairs should never be\\r\\naired there. Never would she consent to that final blow to her pride,\\r\\nnever to the surmises and smiles that would cause. Besides, now she did\\r\\nnot want him to come back, did not want to see him. He had done enough,\\r\\nhurt her too much, put too much upon her. Let him stay away forever!\\r\\nShe tore Alice’s letter to bits, wept with anger. Miss Willy, hearing\\r\\nthe sobs, ran to the gray house across the road, came back with the\\r\\ndoctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of a friendship. A grizzled man, humorous, short\\r\\nof temper, Anne liked him. Gradually she came to look forward to his\\r\\nvisits, always unexpected, apt to be lingering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what of it?” he asked her one day when she complained of a\\r\\nheadache. “Be gone by tomorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was nettled. That, from a doctor. “But what of today? It’s really\\r\\nquite bad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare say. But you’ve got to expect a pain here or there. I’m not\\r\\ngoing to dose you for that, Mrs. Denison.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you treat all your patients this way?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not all. But part of the time. Words to you, syrup to others. When\\r\\nthere’s nothing the matter with ’em.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think there is nothing the matter with me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re sharing the common lot. Women in your condition always think\\r\\nit’s uncommon. But it isn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flushed. Her condition, the common lot. “I know what you mean. But\\r\\nmy position is not quite the same----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder if you do know what I mean?” he interrupted. “I’m not\\r\\nthinking of your physical condition. Call it mental. Or moral, if you\\r\\nlike.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Doctor Severance! Moral!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Not speaking of morals. You find yourself in a situation. I’m a\\r\\nphysician, so I called it a condition. You think it’s uncommon, unique,\\r\\nI dare say. It is not. Not a bit of it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who has been talking to you of my affairs, Doctor Severance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have. Not in words, no. Nor anyone else. No need to. Plain enough.\\r\\nSomething’s gone wrong. You think it’s shaking the world. All women\\r\\ndo. A teacup drops, there’s no other teacup. But isn’t there? Patterns\\r\\nvary, of course. But there remain plenty of teacups. All hold tea or\\r\\ncoffee, most have handles.” He smiled, kindly, tolerantly. “Be mistress\\r\\nof yourself, Mrs. Denison, though your teacups smash.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stood up, biting her lip. “It seems to me,” she said, “that I have\\r\\nbeen mistress of myself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Possibly too much, in a sense,” said he. “Bluff. All women use bluff.\\r\\nSome can’t find anything better. Some don’t want to. Some don’t need\\r\\nto. Some get away with it, even to bluffing themselves. You’ve been\\r\\ntrying to do that, Mrs. Denison. I doubt if you can.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else can one do?” she cried, with a gesture of impotence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! Think it out. There’s a prescription for you. A new one,” he\\r\\nchuckled, “for headaches.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers of his prescriptions she tried to follow. She must walk every\\r\\nday, he insisted, meet the neighbors. But she had never walked without\\r\\nobjective. Up the hill past the church, over the covered bridge to the\\r\\nstore, where men and children stopped talking when she entered and\\r\\nstared at her curiously; in the other direction, down the road to\\r\\nnowhere, and back again. There was no sense in that. Better stay in the\\r\\ngarden with Willy, or sit in the kitchen while Willy was busy at stove\\r\\nor sink. Aimless walks were intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, then,” said the doctor. “See that hill over there? You walk\\r\\nto the top of that hill every day. No detours. There’s a brook or two.\\r\\nJump them. Bit of a marsh. Find the tough clumps of grass. Wet feet\\r\\nwon’t hurt you. Rocks. Go over them. Don’t go around. Straight up and\\r\\nstraight back, if you want to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there are cattle!” she protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Plenty,” said he. “Good company, cattle. Try to find out what they’re\\r\\nthinking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the sun is so hot!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right. Go at night, then,” he laughed. “Good medicine, madam!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time she obeyed him. When the sun dropped below the hill’s summit\\r\\nshe would go warily down through the fields, over the marsh and the\\r\\ndeep, narrow brooklets, watchfully among the cattle who stared, slowly\\r\\nfollowed, at last overcame their own shyness and her panic and nosed at\\r\\nher hands and her skirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take ’em some salt,” said Miss Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed aloud the first time she felt the warm roughness of their\\r\\ntongues on her palm and discovered that after all she was not afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first she thought only of reaching the top of the hill and\\r\\nreturning. So much to be done with, got out of the way. But one day she\\r\\nlingered there until sunset. Another, she came back with her hands\\r\\nfull of forget-me-nots. It was cool on the shaded hillside, warm on the\\r\\ncrest, where the sun still shone. The rocks had gray velvet over them.\\r\\nThere were strange little blossoms in the grass. Things she had never\\r\\nnoticed before began to present themselves. The walk began to be not\\r\\nmerely a prescription, a climb up a hillside. Gradually it was becoming\\r\\nan adventure, an exploration. But there were days so hot that she could\\r\\nnot go out, even when the shadows were long; days when the walls of\\r\\nthe house seemed to flicker in the intensity of the heat like the air\\r\\nabove a fire. Then even the twitter of birds rasped her nerves. The\\r\\nhumming of bees and the cooing of doves were as irritating as a siren’s\\r\\nwhistle. There were days when she was too languid to do more than lie\\r\\non her bed and endure; other hours when the attempt at enduring became\\r\\nalmost madness, when she could have shrieked aloud in protest at her\\r\\nhelplessness. That was what hurt. To be helpless, to have to wait, to\\r\\nendure, rebellious and bitter at the thought of what life had done to\\r\\nher. Life, and Brice. No, she did not want Brice to come back. She\\r\\nhated Brice, hated those years when his silence had fooled her, hated\\r\\nher memories and could not get away from them. They pursued. To look at\\r\\nthe sun did not shut them out, nor to cover her eyes. Memories? They\\r\\nleaped out at her. That sofa. Brice’s frown of anxiety. The chair in\\r\\nthe living-room, hideous, out of place. Why hadn’t he let her tuck it\\r\\naway upstairs? Why did she remember it so?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had been there a while the neighbors began to call. Prim\\r\\nwomen, strangely dressed, figures bulging or angular.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I can’t see anyone,” Anne said, when the first ones came. “Tell\\r\\nthem I’m not at home, or something.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy stood in the bedroom door. For a moment she pressed her lips\\r\\ntogether. Then she said, “Now look here, Annie Warren, I won’t have you\\r\\nbehave so. They’ve come to call. You put on that lavender dress and\\r\\ncome down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not dressed up,” Anne said, smiling a little. During her\\r\\nchildhood Willy had called her Annie. She had loathed the diminutive.\\r\\nWilly knew it. But Willy knew, too, that in submitting to that Anne\\r\\nwould have to submit to more. It held her in bounds, became the symbol\\r\\nof Willy’s authority. Willy was taking the same line now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m folks. I’m not company. You do as I tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did more, did her best, but she could not make conversation with\\r\\nthem. Their talk was of gardens and children, of intimate illnesses and\\r\\nmore intimate affairs in their neighbors’ houses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose they are curious about me,” she said, one day, when she was\\r\\nwatching old Willy perform the rite of making doughnuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s as may be,” said Miss Willy, dryly. “When you’ve lived in the\\r\\ncountry as long as I have you’ll know the easiest way to stop folks\\r\\nfrom bein’ curious is to get in the first word. I told ’em you are my\\r\\nniece. I lied. But I don’t doubt the Lord will forgive me. I said you’s\\r\\na widow, come to live with me to help out. I said you’s going to take\\r\\ncare of me in my old age. No harm in that. It’s a long way off from me\\r\\nyet, praise be. You don’t have to be scared.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Willy! Do I deserve that?” Anne cried, not so much in protest as\\r\\nin wonderment. It was like looking into a mirror, and finding an\\r\\nunaccustomed expression on her own face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Miss Willy, dryly. “I been wondering a\\r\\ngood deal. I don’t know what you aim to do. But it seems to me you’re\\r\\nnot bracing yourself. You’re hiding away from yourself. Trying to.\\r\\nNobody can, in the end, far as I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne thought a moment. “Yes,” she said, “yes. That is just what I am\\r\\ntrying to do. What else is there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You got your life to live.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My life. You call it my life. It is not. This thing that is coming,\\r\\nand what Brice has done to me--my life, my own life has been taken away\\r\\nfrom me. I’m walled in. I’m trapped.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Most folks are walled in, with one thing or another. I never met one\\r\\nthat wasn’t. You ain’t making use of your wall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Use of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else are walls for?” asked Willy, waving a long fork over the\\r\\nfrying pan. “Folks wouldn’t build ’em for nothing. They don’t, if it’s\\r\\nonly to get the rocks out o’ the fields. God doesn’t, either. Walls\\r\\nare useful, if it’s only to brace up against.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, what can I do? It’s easy enough to talk about bracing, setting\\r\\none’s feet firm! My whole world has slipped. What is left?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy smiled. “I am, for one thing.” She returned to the table,\\r\\nbegan to cut out more rings of dough.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne reached her hand across. “Willy, I’m not ungrateful. I appreciate\\r\\neverything you do for me. I know I don’t pay what it’s worth----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now look here, Anne Warren! I take your pay ’cause I got to, and to\\r\\nmake you feel better. But when you talk about gratitude--well, that’s\\r\\nyour business, not mine. Folks that do things for gratitude do them\\r\\nfrom vanity. I hope I ain’t vain. Maybe I am. But I try not to be. Our\\r\\nLord wasn’t vain when he healed the leper and raised up the dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dropped a plateful of rings into the smoking fat. Anne’s eyes were\\r\\nsmarting. “Willy, you make me ashamed,” she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s good,” said Miss Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can I do? Don’t you see how helpless I am?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, since you ask, there’s one thing you can do. You can think of\\r\\nthe folks around here as folks, not lumps of clay. That’s what you been\\r\\ndoing. But you listen to me, Anne Warren! There’s all sorts of clay.\\r\\nI’m not saying you’re our sort. Some clay’s good for bricks, and some\\r\\nfor fine china. There’s some that ain’t good for a thing, as far as I\\r\\nknow, but to keep things from growing. Still and all, the Almighty used\\r\\nclay. Didn’t look about him for anything better. He’d just finished\\r\\nmaking a new world, too, all spick and span, with flowers and waters\\r\\nand snakes and everything. Might have taken his pick, but he found clay\\r\\nplenty good enough. There! That’s the last. Want a hot one?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took the doughnut, went out of doors to a chair under the apple\\r\\ntree. The old woman’s talk had startled her. Notwithstanding a lurking\\r\\nsense of shame and deserved admonishment her thoughts were not of\\r\\nherself. Where had old Willy learned her philosophy? Surely philosophy,\\r\\nor wisdom, did not accrue to one. It was no thistle-seed, to be blown\\r\\nwhite-winged on the wind, to germinate wherever it fell, on rock or\\r\\nroadside or--clay. Willy’s life had been bare, so bare. Anne’s thought\\r\\nbrought back, in one of those oddly photographic flashes with which\\r\\nthe mind visualizes a long train of circumstance in a single picture,\\r\\nthe coming of Willy to her father’s house and events leading up to\\r\\nit. There had been many women, called, in the small-town phraseology,\\r\\nhousekeepers. Between the time of her mother’s death and the coming of\\r\\nWilly, Professor Warren’s continuous advertisements for help were the\\r\\njoke and the pity of his neighbors. Anne could not remember her mother,\\r\\nbut she remembered the succession of housekeepers, not as individuals,\\r\\nbut as people who got in her way, who tried to restrain her, on whom\\r\\nshe used all her childish arts of retaliation and torment until they\\r\\nleft in despair or dudgeon. She remembered the day when Miss Willy\\r\\ncame, a small gray-clad person with a carpet bag that instantly claimed\\r\\nthe child’s attention and afterward became an object of admiration.\\r\\nThere was no other like it in town, and she used to bribe Alice into\\r\\ndocility, and even occasionally Nicky, by a sight of it in the attic.\\r\\nSometimes Nicky held out for the further bribe of being allowed to\\r\\nmarch up and down the length of the attic with it in her hands,\\r\\nwhile Alice and Anne would chant, “Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are\\r\\nmarching.” Alice always wanted to sing “Onward Christian Soldiers,”\\r\\nbut Nicky and Anne agreed that a carpet bag was not an appropriate\\r\\nimplement for Christian soldiers. Besides, one couldn’t step as quickly\\r\\nto that tune as to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that first day Anne had eyed Miss Willy solemnly, biding her time.\\r\\nShe had no doubt that this new one would be like the others, easy to\\r\\nvanquish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her name’s Willy,” she told her father that night at the supper table.\\r\\nThe professor, harassed, poor man, as he always was when confronted\\r\\nwith his daughter after a long day at the high school, weakly\\r\\nremonstrated. “That’s what she said it was,” Anne insisted. “She told\\r\\nme to call her that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, surely,” the professor protested, weakly, looking to the end of\\r\\nthe table for help. Miss Willy was all placidity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She can, if she’s a mind to,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good man’s frown of helpless perplexity had not lessened. “But\\r\\nsurely, there must be another name, a name more, ah----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know,” Miss Willy had answered, tranquilly. “Folks do seem to find\\r\\nit kind o’ queer. But that’s what I was christened. After my pa. Not\\r\\nWillamena nor anything like that. Just plain Willy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I think your--ah--last name----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It don’t make much difference. That’s Willis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was still solemn, her eyes demurely downcast. Willy Willis. She’d\\r\\nknow how to deal with that! But her hopes and intentions met their\\r\\nsmall Waterloo no later than that same night. The campaign was short\\r\\nand decisive.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I get to bed by myself,” she told Willy. But Willy replied, “Not this\\r\\nnight, you don’t. Not till I get those snarls out o’ your hair, anyway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I like it this way. I don’t like to have anybody else comb my hair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Liking ain’t getting. You stand still. I won’t hurt any more than I\\r\\ngot to. But those snarls come out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Miss Willy remained, saw her married, and a year or two later\\r\\nwatched while the professor’s life ebbed, while Anne and Brice were\\r\\nhurrying towards the town Anne had left with so little reluctance. Then\\r\\nshe had come back to Heathville. That was old Willy’s life, as Anne\\r\\nknew it. Where and how had wisdom, philosophy, come to her?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening Anne asked, “Willy, have you ever lived anywhere else but\\r\\nhere and with father and me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy was knitting. “No,” she said. “Never was much of a mover.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled. “How did you happen to come to us?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wanted my freedom,” said Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Freedom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I guess maybe most folks do, sooner or later. My aunt was a good\\r\\nwoman. This was her house. She took me in when ma died. But I wanted my\\r\\nfreedom. So when I saw your pa’s advertisement, I packed up and went.\\r\\nThen I come back again. The house had been shut up for years. My land,\\r\\nit was dirty! I don’t know when I’ve had such a good time as I did\\r\\ncleaning it up. And the garden all weeds. When I was a girl, this place\\r\\nused to seem kind of little, shut off in the hills the way it is and\\r\\nall. There didn’t seem to be anything to do. Now--dear me, sirs! The\\r\\ndays ain’t half long enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must help you more,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy looked over her spectacles, went on with her knitting,\\r\\nchanging a needle. “I wasn’t hinting,” said she. “I like the work.\\r\\nFunny, it’s just what my aunt used to do, when I was a girl. Maybe the\\r\\ndifference is now it’s my own. I don’t know. Only, I’m free now. I\\r\\nguess folks get to know about that, when they’re old. I had a squirrel\\r\\nonce. It lived in a cage for years. Went round and round on a wheel\\r\\nthing at one side of the cage. I thought, ‘Poor thing! It’s old. It\\r\\nain’t got long to live. I’ll give it its freedom before it dies.’ So I\\r\\nset the cage on the porch, and opened the door. The squirrel went out\\r\\nlike a flash, and ran up a tree. But the next day it was back in its\\r\\ncage again, making the wheel go round and round.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were days when the heat was less, when midsummer quietude brooded\\r\\nupon the hills, and fields exhaled the odors of growing things and\\r\\nwoods exuded their winter-stored moisture to the summons of the wind\\r\\nacross the tree-tops; long mornings when Anne listlessly washed the\\r\\ndishes and made the beds and dusted, while old Willy toiled outside;\\r\\nand long afternoons when Anne walked, sometimes on the road through\\r\\nthe glen, sometimes to the doctor’s prescribed hill-top and back,\\r\\nsometimes, as her strength grew, to farther pastures. To those walks\\r\\nshe was driven and lured: driven by her desire to get away from the\\r\\nhouse, from Willy’s chatter, from her own thoughts; and lured as a\\r\\nchild goes looking for fairies by a feeling that never quite came to\\r\\nconsciousness that somewhere, sometime, she would find something, some\\r\\nbalm of the spirit, some response or enlightenment. Sometimes she\\r\\nwalked in desperation, taking with her the burden of her rebellion.\\r\\nThis place, to be buried here! She must, must get away, anywhere,\\r\\nanywhere. But at least the long walks gave her dreamless sleep. In\\r\\nAugust Nicky came for a Sunday. Alice and the children were at the\\r\\nseashore. Nicky was in a quiet mood; they spent the long afternoon\\r\\nunder the apple tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You look at me as though I were one of your ‘cases,’” Anne said,\\r\\naware of Veronica’s covert inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do I?” Nicky calmly responded. “I wasn’t thinking about you at all, if\\r\\nyou want to know. I was thinking about myself--and Ambrose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’d be glad to know that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky was lounging back, one knee over the other, arms under her head.\\r\\n“You know, Anne--this mess of yours--it’s made me like Ambrose rather\\r\\nbetter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I’ve proved your contention that marriage is a failure? Made\\r\\nyou think you are right in your eternal argument with Ambrose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no. I always knew I was. But Ambrose has been so mad about it. He\\r\\nwas always so darned meek, before. I rather prefer Ambrose mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rôle of the strong man, the cave-man,” Anne laughed. “Even you\\r\\ncan’t escape the feminine complex, Nick, the longing to cling, to have\\r\\nsomething to cling to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky chuckled. “There’s only one George,” she said, cryptically. “And\\r\\ntime hasn’t finished with George yet, nor with Alice. One thing I’ve\\r\\nnoticed about clinging vines, feminine and otherwise. They rot the\\r\\nstump they cling to. If it isn’t a stump, they smother it, keep it from\\r\\nfruiting. And if by any chance the old tree’s too strong for them, the\\r\\nvine is no good. There you are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat up. “Well, I have failed. I admit that. Or to put it the other\\r\\nway, maybe the right way, Brice failed. But just the same, Nicky, it\\r\\ndoes not have to be failure. There ought to be a sense of duty, if\\r\\nnothing more, that would bind. Brice failed in that. I never did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t you? But anyway, this rot about duty. Oh, I know it has its\\r\\nuses. It helps along the propagation of the race. But when you think\\r\\nwhat it does to poor old humanity--! No, old girl. If I should marry\\r\\nI’d have to be jolly well certain that there’d be something more left\\r\\nafter ten years than mere duty. That salt would have no savor for me.\\r\\nAs it hasn’t for Brice, apparently.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have stopped thinking about Brice. I prefer to stop talking about\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, after I’ve given you a message from Ambrose. They’ve done\\r\\nall they can to trace Brice. Ambrose asked me to say that he cannot\\r\\ncollect on the life insurance for you. Not evidence enough. He wants\\r\\nto know if you’d like to sell the house. He’d buy it himself on a\\r\\nquit-claim deed. Nobody else would, without Brice’s signature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How Ambrose must have loved offering me charity,” said Anne, bitterly.\\r\\n“Tell him I thank him beyond words. But I have enough. Between forty\\r\\nand fifty a month.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky sat up, too. “Good Lord, Anne! Is that all? What’ll you--do?” she\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bit her lip, made a helpless gesture with her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet gradually, during the weeks she had been in Heathville, her sense\\r\\nof values had been readjusting themselves. Here there was all but\\r\\nnothing to spend money for.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you’re richer than anybody in this whole village,” Miss Willy had\\r\\nsaid, “unless it’s that Kent man and the doctor. Even the minister only\\r\\ngets two hundred a year, and he’s well off. Forty dollars a month--my\\r\\nland!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was watching the old woman at work in her garden one day, squatting\\r\\nbetween the rows, weeding. “Why do you work so for those things, stupid\\r\\nthings like beets and carrots?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re for winter. The cabbages, too, and potatoes. Of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why do you grow them at all? Why not buy them?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy looked up. “I just told you. They are for winter. What\\r\\nelse’ll we eat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there’s a store!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A store? My goodness, child! Folks around here don’t buy things like\\r\\nthem at the store. It don’t keep ’em, anyway. But even if it did, who’d\\r\\nbuy what they grow in the garden?”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet even then Anne did not dream of the ways and means, the contrivings\\r\\nand savings, that went into life in the village, Miss Willy’s and that\\r\\nof her neighbors. Their meals were plain enough. Anne observed, without\\r\\ncomment, that whatever was bought or brought in from the garden was\\r\\neaten, sooner or later, to the last mouthful, by human or cat or fowl.\\r\\nNothing was wasted.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had noticed the clothes worn by the women, and there was the affair\\r\\nof Miss Willy’s best bonnet, donned only for Sundays and the monthly\\r\\nchurch supper. “I do think it becomes me,” said Willy complacently.\\r\\n“I’ve had it six years going on seven. It’s just as good as new.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was the boy Dorilliam. The name had amused her. She\\r\\nrepeated it, smiling, one evening, and Miss Willy said, “Yes, it’s\\r\\nreal high-sounding. He’s the seventh. Mis’ Wells, she wanted a girl,\\r\\nall the rest being boys. Had her heart set on calling it Dora. When it\\r\\ncome, well, she was always romantic, Mis’ Wells was, and she never had\\r\\nmuch of a chance to break out. I guess it did her some good to call him\\r\\nDorilliam.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the midsummer heat Anne protested against the old woman’s\\r\\neternal work in the garden; she would pay Dorilliam to hoe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s twenty cents an hour!” Miss Willy cried. “My goodness, child!\\r\\nTwenty cents for one hour, and sugar the price it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early coolness of September her walks became longer. The\\r\\nheaviness of her languor was less, yet one day when she reached the\\r\\ncrest of the hill and sat down in the shade of a weather-worn maple she\\r\\nknew that she was tired, not with that terrible weight of the spirit\\r\\nwhich had shadowed her for so long, borne her down, but as a workman\\r\\nis tired at noon and sits down, gratefully, that his body may refresh\\r\\nitself with food and rest and cessation from toil. From where she sat\\r\\nno habitation of man was to be seen. The world seemed a place empty\\r\\nof animate life, for even the cattle were below in the marsh, out of\\r\\nsight. Haze lay on the hills, merging them into the sky. The patches of\\r\\nsweetfern were already darkening to ripeness, and the rock at her side\\r\\nwas warm to the touch. Asters and goldenrod glowed in the sunlight, the\\r\\nsumach was red. Beyond, down the valley, here and there in the woods,\\r\\na white birch shone, slender, fastidious, seeming to tread its way\\r\\ndaintily forward to the eye’s finding, like a conscious beauty at a\\r\\nball. Upon the meadows cloud-shadows lingered, and under the maple was\\r\\nshade, quiet and shade.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent. Why were things different, today? Many times she had\\r\\nlooked on the same scene, inwardly shrunk from its emptiness. But\\r\\nthis quietude in the drenching sunlight and the cool shade, this was\\r\\nnot emptiness. Peace. Yes, it was a sort of peace, but something was\\r\\ngoing on in it, through it. There was life working. Not hurrying,\\r\\nnot crowding, silent, but working on and on. Trees gnarled by winter\\r\\nstorms, rocks laid bare and carved by frost and ice; a land worn rugged\\r\\nand seamed from its age-long battle, but still with vitality and a germ\\r\\nof things to be, things that would die to grow again, grow and become\\r\\nlovely with a perpetual renewing. And even after fruition and harvest,\\r\\nthrough winter, to spring, on and on, ever to be renewed. Life.\\r\\nSuddenly, there under the sheltering boughs of the old tree, there\\r\\nfacing the sunlight, she put her hand to her heart. Another heart\\r\\nwithin her was beating, another life had stirred.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an hour she sat there, her arms clasping her knees, her head bowed\\r\\nabove them. A great stillness pervaded her. Life going on, herself part\\r\\nof it, needed. That was it, needed. Fitting in with it. Necessary to\\r\\nits scheme, a part of its plan; a utensil of service, and servant as\\r\\nwell. And for so long she had thought there was no plan at all; or, if\\r\\nthere were, that its parts were hopelessly jumbled. Strange. If one\\r\\nwere a part, or were needed, then there was something to do, something\\r\\nto wait for, to hope for.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she stood up, and looked again over the drowsy loveliness\\r\\nof the world. Slowly she went down the hill, and placidly. There\\r\\nwas nothing to hurry for, no need now to walk and walk so that she\\r\\ncould not think. When she came in sight of the spire and houses\\r\\nof Heathville, even those looked different, less poor and sordid,\\r\\nfriendlier. Miss Willy was not in the kitchen. There came a faint echo\\r\\nof hammering from the direction of the hen-house, and Anne took her way\\r\\ntowards it. The downy chicks that had scratched under the rhubarb had\\r\\nlong since grown into frisky birds large enough to be promoted to the\\r\\nprivilege of roosting with their mothers and aunts in the hen-house.\\r\\nMiss Willy was there now, mysteriously wielding a hammer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth are you doing?” Anne asked, from the doorway.\\r\\n“Carpentering--you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy turned, her mouth as full of nails as a seamstress’s of\\r\\npins. “I’m making a walk for that poor blind chicken,” said she. She\\r\\ntook the nails from between her lips, and pointed with pride to a\\r\\ncontrivance she had achieved, a board slanting from floor to roost,\\r\\nwith occasional cross-pieces on it. “There, look at that! Ain’t that\\r\\ngrand? Dunno why I didn’t think of it before. That poor chicken has\\r\\nbeen trying its level best to jump on the roost every night, and\\r\\nbumping its head on the board and all. Must a felt like a body knocking\\r\\nat the Gate and Saint Peter away on vacation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what good is that queer-looking board?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you see, child? Use your eyes! That’s a walk. I been coming out\\r\\nhere every night to put that poor thing on its roost. Come winter, and\\r\\nI’d get good and tired of it. Besides, think of its feelings. Now I’ll\\r\\njust train it to peck around and find its own walk and climb up. Get\\r\\non the roost like its folks, without having to be helped all the time.\\r\\nNobody likes to be helped all the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s face softened a little. “And I would have killed that blind\\r\\nchicken long ago,” she said, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, I wouldn’t. Lots o’ folks with two eyes in their head see\\r\\nless than that chicken and have no more sense. It’s got a right to\\r\\nlive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen autumn came, Dorilliam set up a stove in the front parlor, that\\r\\nroom which until Anne’s arrival had been kept for the most part closed,\\r\\na ceremonial elegance of which Miss Willy was very proud. The house\\r\\nitself had none of the dignity of the doctor’s and some of the other\\r\\nolder ones. Apparently it represented the imaginative efflorescence of\\r\\nsome country builder of half a century before, limited in means and\\r\\nmethod. There were but two sizable rooms on the first floor, parlor and\\r\\nkitchen. Miss Willy’s bedroom opened off from the kitchen, little more\\r\\nthan a large cupboard, its space amply filled with bed and pine bureau,\\r\\nwhile back of the kitchen, longer than the house itself, was the shed\\r\\nwhere wood was stored and a miscellany of oddments that were mysteries\\r\\nto Anne. She had pleaded to have the wall-papered fireboard taken away\\r\\nfrom the parlor. An open fire would have made of the room a different\\r\\nplace. But Miss Willy looked troubled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how’d we heat your bedroom?” she asked. “Mine’s real nice and\\r\\nwarm, opening off from the kitchen like it does. But if the stove pipe\\r\\ndon’t run up through yours, child, how’ll we heat it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time Anne understood the purpose of the round hole in\\r\\nher floor that had seemed so mysterious, the hole through which she\\r\\ncould see one red rose on the parlor carpet. She had supposed that\\r\\nit was left for the purpose of being able to look down upon callers.\\r\\nIt amused her to be brought face to face with so elemental a problem\\r\\nas heating a house. It had startled her to find that there was no\\r\\nbathroom, surprised her that the water in the kitchen came from a pump,\\r\\nnot from a faucet. Yet those things did not concern her, and in the\\r\\nmatter of the fireplace she yielded. In time Dorilliam set up a stove.\\r\\nWhen she first saw Willy come staggering in with an armful of wood,\\r\\nshe protested. It was not woman’s work. Dorilliam must do it. But\\r\\nthereafter, mysteriously, the fire in the stove seemed to feed itself,\\r\\nand in the evenings old Willy would drop wearily into her chair and\\r\\nnod. Vaguely Anne wondered why she was so tired, now that the garden\\r\\nwork was over, the small crops harvested and stored away in the cellar.\\r\\nYet, after all, the endless monotony of the days were enough to weary\\r\\nanyone. Morning, drudgery, night, morning again, and more drudgery.\\r\\nThat summed up life in Heathville, as far as she could discern.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the autumn rains her restlessness returned and times of rebellion,\\r\\nnow not against the coming of the child, but at the aridity she was\\r\\nliving through. Alice wrote insistently that she should come to stay\\r\\nwith her and George, later to go to a hospital. Anne refused less\\r\\nbecause of reluctance to accept Alice’s bounty than because she was\\r\\nunwilling to encounter old friends, old acquaintances, to have to\\r\\nmeet their pity or amusement. Now she would not let her mind dwell\\r\\nupon the difficulties of the future because that would be bad for the\\r\\nchild. This was a time when she could do nothing but wait, and this\\r\\nwas as good a place as any. Later, of course, she must find some means\\r\\nof making a real livelihood. Live in Heathville, her child, hers? Of\\r\\ncourse she would find some means of escaping that.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the radiant days of October she frequently drove with the\\r\\ndoctor on his rounds in a small battered car that possessed a\\r\\npersonality of its own. She liked the doctor. He was “country-queer,”\\r\\nas he described himself, but his was the only mind she had encountered\\r\\nin Heathville that could think, or express its thoughts. As to that,\\r\\nshe believed that Dorilliam’s mother and the other women she had met\\r\\ndid not think at all, but lived by instinct, or went about their\\r\\ntasks like trained animals, except that for them there was no reward\\r\\nof caress or tidbit. Purposeless, stupid, they seemed to her. Dr.\\r\\nSeverance was neither. He called his car Sally.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Named her after an old mare I had. Died in the harness, as I hope to.\\r\\nOne thing she does almost as well as old Sally did. She gets me there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet apparently Sally did not always hold that intention. More than\\r\\nonce the doctor had to dismount and do mysterious things to Sally,\\r\\nalmost at times, as Anne once told him, laughing, amounting to major\\r\\noperations. Once Sally’s temperament overcame her not far from a small\\r\\nbrown cottage set back in the woods; after some minutes of futile\\r\\nministrations on the doctor’s part, Sally still remained where she\\r\\nhad stopped, soundless and motionless. Anne had stepped down and was\\r\\nwalking along the road through the yellow leaves. As she repassed the\\r\\ncottage a man came out and after a look towards the car beyond smiled\\r\\nat Anne. She had become used by now to the friendly custom in the\\r\\ncountry of taking acquaintanceship for granted. They walked back to the\\r\\ncar together. The doctor, hands on hip, glared in mock ferociousness\\r\\nat the other man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come to try one of your faith cures on her, I suppose,” he growled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other man chuckled. “Might try it on you, Tom,” he remarked.\\r\\n“You’re a little excited, aren’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve worked on the blame thing an hour at least. She won’t go,”\\r\\nspluttered the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s like you medical men. You fiddle and tinker and dose, and think\\r\\nyou’ve done all of it. You’re always forgetting there’s something else.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor snorted. “I’ve heard you say that before! Look here, you\\r\\nRufus--you use faith on Sally and get her to start, and I’ll take up\\r\\nsome stock in that faith of yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man called Rufus had moved to the side of the car. His hair was\\r\\nquite white, his shoulders were stooped, and life had worn marks on\\r\\nhis face; but he bore the indefinable stamp of the intellectual. Anne\\r\\ndecided at once that he was not a native of Heathville. He seemed to\\r\\nsmile easily, or else the smile never quite left his eyes. Now he\\r\\nbent towards the driving-wheel of the car, peering as though from\\r\\nnear-sightedness, and stood up to grin at the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve long since discovered, as I’ve told you before--as you say, Tom,\\r\\nquite as you say!--that there is some eternal spark that moves things.\\r\\nThere must be a spark, Tom, somewhere. In the case of your Sally why\\r\\nnot turn on your spark, Tom, and see----”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor’s mouth opened. A blank look came over his face. But he,\\r\\ntoo, came up to the side of the car. He reached over, touched a small\\r\\nlever, and instantly Sally responded with rattles and tremblings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hell!” said the doctor. Anne laughed aloud, long and gayly as she\\r\\nhad not laughed in months. “I beg your pardon,” the doctor muttered.\\r\\n“Ladies present.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Anne’s laugh still rang out, and the man called Rufus was chuckling\\r\\nwith her. The doctor was red. He climbed into the car.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who was that?” asked Anne, when they had passed the brown house with\\r\\nthe woods at its back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old fool,” said the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bit her lip. “Well, but who else?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor permitted himself to smile. “Name’s Kent, though you’re\\r\\nlikely to hear him called ‘The fellow that bought the Carscadden\\r\\nplace.’ Nobody knew where he came from, nor who he was. Had to call\\r\\nhim something, so the title sort o’ got itself hung on to him. Folks\\r\\nthought, I believe, he was some relation of the Carscaddens, who hadn’t\\r\\nlived there for a generation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does he live there alone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lord, no; got a Jap servant, for one thing, and a wife, and there’s\\r\\nalways a houseful o’ lame ducks, human and otherwise. You’ll have to go\\r\\nthere and make his acquaintance some day. He’s a great friend of mine,\\r\\nreally. But Sally don’t like him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” said Anne. “Because of his principles, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor sniffed. “Something like that,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day they were driving along together, slowly, in the lace-like\\r\\nshade of the woods. Anne had been saying little; these drives with the\\r\\ndoctor brought a measure of soothing to her spirit. By this time the\\r\\nbrilliance of the autumn foliage was past, lying in golden tribute on\\r\\nthe earth that had given it life. Now and again the little car would\\r\\nstop before some house while the doctor went in, leaving Anne musing,\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good people, those,” the old man said, as he drove away from one\\r\\nlittle house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so poor,” said Anne. “I saw four or five children there, in that\\r\\ntiny house.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor considered a moment. “In one sense,” he said slowly,\\r\\nthinking it out, “poverty is having the consciousness of poverty. Those\\r\\npeople have never had more. They have no consciousness of being poor.\\r\\nThey are not poor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but the fact remains that they are. Look at the house, think of\\r\\nthe lack of advantages.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what are those?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Advantages? But, surely, one knows!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! What are they, really, comprehensively? Can you say, Mrs.\\r\\nDenison? In the sense in which you mean, all a matter of comparison,\\r\\naren’t they? Well, comparison with what? With something a man has not\\r\\ngot and thinks he wants, or thinks he ought to have, or thinks somebody\\r\\nelse has gotten ahead of him by possessing? What’s the end of that sort\\r\\nof thinking?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, but not to think, not to want, not to aspire!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wasn’t talking of aspirations.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But weren’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor shook his head. “You’ll have to take that up with Rufus some\\r\\nday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That queer man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he’s queer. Old fool, as I said. Not that he’s old as he looks.\\r\\nBut he is queer, though he’s got a lot of sound sense in him, too. He’s\\r\\nthought things out. You’ll have to know Rufus.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he has thought out some sort of philosophy like the one you’ve been\\r\\npropounding it’s greatly to his credit, but it doesn’t affect the real\\r\\nquestion of poverty, does it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Doesn’t it? Well, you’ll see. But let me tell you this, Mrs. Denison:\\r\\nthe normal man is never a poor man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps that accounts for so few being normal. So many are poor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t mean it that way. You know I don’t. I mean that the normal man\\r\\ncannot be poor, because he has all there is that’s worth while, because\\r\\nbeing normal about sums up to having a good digestion, doing a day’s\\r\\nwork, getting a little happiness and giving some. Get that into life,\\r\\nand you’ve got about all there is, in the ultimate analysis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hear a doctor talking,” Anne commented, and added, “Your friend back\\r\\nthere suggested one more element. He mentioned a spark.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor looked down at her sideways, pursing his lips. “H’m!” said\\r\\nhe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer thoughts went back again and again to that conversation. Was that\\r\\nall? Must she endure, and find nothing more than that? Health and work,\\r\\nit summed up to, for happiness was only a fleeting illusion. She saw no\\r\\nriches in the doctor’s circle. Poverty was not merely having no money,\\r\\nand she shrank from poverty for herself and the child. Thinness of joy,\\r\\nmeagerness? No, no! That should not be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought set her pacing restlessly up and down the small overheated\\r\\nroom on an evening when the rain beat against the windows. It was\\r\\nSunday, and Willy observed the day by going to church in the morning,\\r\\nwhatever the weather, and by having their dinner at two o’clock instead\\r\\nof at noon. The displaced meal hour set the day awry. Except for that\\r\\nthere seemed to be no change from other days. Willy was forever busy at\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My goodness, child, that lamp’s smoking,” she said, when she came into\\r\\nthe room. She took the low rocking-chair by the table, the cat Buster\\r\\njumping into her lap. “I been thinking,” she went on. “When I was a\\r\\nchild, they used to call Sunday the Lord’s day. That’s funny, now ain’t\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nEven old Willy’s chatter was better than the dreary persistence of the\\r\\nrain. “Funny?” Anne asked, smiling a little. “Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As if every day isn’t the Lord’s day,” said Willy, her faded eyes\\r\\nlooking at Anne, looking away again. “I just guess he sees to that.\\r\\nHe’s got us all in his hand every day, Sundays and all; and every day,\\r\\ncome day go day, he keeps right on working and looking out for us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled a little. She had heard a good deal of Willy’s primitive\\r\\ntheology during the past months.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not but what I know Sunday’s by rights set apart for us humans,” Willy\\r\\nwent on. “A good thing it is, too. I’ve heard folks talk hard things\\r\\nabout men, and about women, too, that does one way on weekdays and\\r\\nanother on Sundays. But I say--land!--it’s better to behave decent one\\r\\nday of the week than never at all, poor critters. And if that’s being a\\r\\nhypocrite, well, it’s better to be a hypocrite one day than seven.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed aloud. Miss Willy stroked Buster, who purred like a\\r\\ntea-kettle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another funny thing is how people’s mistakes get mixed up with their\\r\\nsins, in folks’s minds. I don’t doubt the Lord sees which is which. I\\r\\ndon’t doubt he’s capable of handling ’em both. But I often think folks\\r\\ntry too hard to do the untangling themselves. I don’t know. But I’m\\r\\ngoing on seventy-three. I’ve come to the conclusion we’d be better off\\r\\nif we’d just leave it all to the Lord.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a comfortable doctrine, my dear,” Anne remarked. “But if you’d\\r\\nlet it work out, wouldn’t it be a little like giving the kitten the\\r\\nwork-basket to play with?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy looked at her over the top of her spectacles. “That’s just\\r\\nwhat the good Lord has done,” said she, “given us the work-basket\\r\\nto play with. And a real good snarl we make out of it, most of us.\\r\\nBut having given us a work-basket apiece, as you might say, he don’t\\r\\nexpect the kittens to take on themselves to say who’s to blame for the\\r\\ntangles. That’s where we don’t follow the Lord’s way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no question of that,” Anne agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. And that’s what you’re doing, Anne Warren. You and Brice had one\\r\\nwork-basket between you. Somehow it’s got into an awful mess. So you’re\\r\\nscratching at Brice, thinking it’s his fault.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want to talk about Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare say. But I’m going to talk about him. Whenever I’ve a mind to.\\r\\nRight now what I got to say is, that baby that’s coming has got a right\\r\\nto his father, and his father has got a right to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brice has gone. They have tried to find him. He’s gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Maybe. But you’re forgetting that he’s the baby’s father. I\\r\\nknow. I don’t say they haven’t done all they could do to get hold of\\r\\nBrice. But they ought to do more than they can. There ain’t anything\\r\\nimpossible, after you get it done. The baby belongs to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne jumped to her feet. “No! No, he’s mine! All mine!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s the Lord’s, Anne Warren. And the Lord’s fixed it so’s he had to\\r\\nhave father and mother both. You’re setting yourself up in the Lord’s\\r\\nplace when you pass judgment on Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has set judgment upon himself. He has gone. If he never sees his\\r\\nson, that will be judgment. He deserves it. I am not sorry. No, I’m not\\r\\nsorry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time of weakness when she scarcely realized the small creature\\r\\nat her side, after other days of watching him with wonder, and days of\\r\\nsitting in the sunny window behind the geraniums with the baby asleep\\r\\nin a basket nearby, Anne said to Miss Willy:\\r\\n\\r\\n“His name is Warren.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWilly looked at her. Anne saw protest in the look, but she smiled,\\r\\nserenely, securely. “His name is Warren,” she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H’m,” said old Willy. “Well. After your poor dear father. Well, you’re\\r\\nhis mother. I suppose you got a right to call him what you’re a mind\\r\\nto.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am his mother. Oh, I am,” Anne agreed, lifting the baby, snuggling\\r\\nhim up to her face. She knew well enough what Willy implied. For this\\r\\nwas Brice’s child, like Brice in every small feature, like him even\\r\\nin the soft, reddish hair on his head. But her whole being protested\\r\\nagainst what Willy wanted. Another Brice--all the more reason why he\\r\\nshould not bear Brice’s name. No one should have a share in him, Brice\\r\\nleast of all. She denied Brice’s share in him, even to herself. He\\r\\nwas hers, all hers, miraculously flesh of her flesh, hers to love, to\\r\\nmold. He should be more and more hers. Often during that marvelous\\r\\nspring and summer the same jealous thought returned to her. The child\\r\\nflourished and grew, a sunny baby. His first smile was for Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that, now,” the old woman cried. “Who’d a thought it? He knows\\r\\nme. He knows his old Willy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne snatched the baby up to her breast. She had watched for that first\\r\\nsmile, longed for it, wanted it for herself. But a moment afterwards\\r\\nshe was ashamed. Willy was the slave of them both, toiling and loving\\r\\nwith a devotion as absolute as that of the nun whose life is centered\\r\\nin the cross on the altar and the red light before it, who spends\\r\\nher nights on her knees and would starve herself, castigate herself,\\r\\nreadily give up her body and soul and her life bit by bit that her Lord\\r\\nmight perceive and accept her adoration. Willy would come in a dozen\\r\\ntimes during the day to look at the child. Her face became rapt when\\r\\nhis tiny fingers curled about one of hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To think this should happen to me,” she said more than once. “To think\\r\\nof your baby being right here in my house, where I can see him and all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she would trot off to her work again, trotting more slowly and\\r\\nfalteringly as the months passed. Anne, absorbed in the child, took it\\r\\nas a matter of course that things were done for them both. She did not\\r\\nobserve that Willy’s hours of work were longer than they had ever been.\\r\\nOne day in the spring she surprised the old woman spading the garden,\\r\\nand remonstrated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can do it,” said Willy. “I like to do it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense,” said Anne. “Dorilliam can do it in half the time. I’ll go\\r\\nup the hill after supper and tell him to come tomorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now look here, Anne Warren, I won’t have you wasting your money that\\r\\nway. You got to save.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed a little. “Save out of what I have? What’s the use? It\\r\\nwould never amount to anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You got plenty to save something out of, if you don’t go frittering it\\r\\naway. You got to save for Warren’s education.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Land,” said Dorilliam’s mother, when she dropped in one morning while\\r\\nthe baby was having his bath by the kitchen stove, “mine never had all\\r\\nthose fixin’s. I just washed ’em off when they were dirty, and kept ’em\\r\\nwell fed, and let ’em cry and let ’em sleep. A baby ain’t only a baby,\\r\\nwhen all’s said and done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing. That, doubtless, was true, as far as it went. But to\\r\\ncompare the young Warren with these country children? As well compare\\r\\ngrain-sacks and silk. There were things about her child that she had\\r\\nnever observed in others. She never tired of pondering on all his small\\r\\nperfections. Her state was not peace, but absorption. The rest of the\\r\\nworld was shut out, thrust aside, while she tended her baby and watched\\r\\nthe developing wondrousness of him. For the first time in her life she\\r\\nwas absorbed in something besides herself, yet this was inextricably\\r\\nherself, her own as nothing else had ever been. As his individuality\\r\\ndeveloped she hugged that thought to her more and more. Even while\\r\\nshe adored them and gloried in them, she was jealous of the will and\\r\\nimpulses that came from somewhere within his small self. For when young\\r\\nWarren wanted to sleep or to stay awake, he did so. When he was hungry,\\r\\nhe made his want known vociferously. He loved the warm water about his\\r\\nplump little body, and yelled when he was lifted out of it. He hated to\\r\\nhave his nose and his ears touched, and decisively said so. Here was\\r\\nsomething apart from his mother, not hers at all, needs and preferences\\r\\nnot springing from her, the will of another creature to which she must\\r\\nyield, which she resented and feared and adored.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Got a will of his own,” said Willy one day when the two of them had\\r\\ntried in vain for an hour or more to get him to sleep. When their\\r\\npatience was threadbare, both vanquished by the utter helplessness of\\r\\nthe adult before a baby’s unreasoned persistence, the boy had abruptly\\r\\nstopped crying, looked into the old woman’s face, smiled divinely, and\\r\\ndropped into slumber. She laid him down on the sofa. “Just wanted to\\r\\nmake us understand once for all that he wouldn’t go to sleep till he\\r\\ngot good and ready,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bent over the child. “He’s his mother’s own boy,” she said, with\\r\\nthe fatuous sentimentality of the parent who has just been worsted in\\r\\na battle with her offspring and finds balm in her tenderness, pride in\\r\\nthe strength of the victor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy sniffed. “He is, and he isn’t,” said she. She had no sooner\\r\\ndropped into the rocking-chair than Buster jumped into her lap. “Some\\r\\nof him’s yours and some is his father’s. You needn’t look at me that\\r\\nway, Anne Warren. And some of him belongs to himself, and a good part’s\\r\\nthe Lord’s. What the Lord means him to be you can’t tell much about.\\r\\nIt’s got to come out. I’ve always noticed that the Lord does a lot of\\r\\nmixing of his stuffs, before he finishes a job. Same as I do with my\\r\\nbread. And when he’s got a thing turned out at last, it’s cram full of\\r\\nmost everything, good and bad, sense and foolishness. It works pretty\\r\\nwell, but it needs a whole lot of oiling to keep it a-going. The baby’s\\r\\nlike that. There’s a lot in that baby that’s going to come out, do what\\r\\nyou will. You got to help him get started, but I guess when you think\\r\\nhe’s all finished it’ll be just about the time he’s beginning to run\\r\\nwith his own machinery, and if you poke your hand into it you’ll likely\\r\\nget pinched. He belongs to himself, Anne, and don’t you forget that.\\r\\nNot that you’re likely to get much of a chance to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled. Willy was not a mother, Willy could not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no chart which tells how a mother’s time goes. Anne did not\\r\\nknow how the months went. In the autumn Alice and George stopped for an\\r\\nhour. They had been motoring, and Alice was anxious to get back to the\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Darling, are you comfortable here? Why won’t you come back with us?”\\r\\nAlice asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. “No, I’m not comfortable, as you know comfort, Alice. But\\r\\nthis is the place for me until Wanny is a little older. Of course I\\r\\nam not going to live here forever. When he is old enough to play with\\r\\nother children I shall have to take him away from here. There will be\\r\\nthe question of school, too. I shall have to learn how to make money.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were alone under the apple tree. George had driven to the store\\r\\nfor gasoline. For a moment Alice looked off, vaguely, at a distant\\r\\nhill-top where already a maple gleamed yellow; then without turning to\\r\\nAnne she asked,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you hear that Ranney is married?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I supposed he would be. In the spring, wasn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice shook her head. “No, just lately. Not to that girl he was engaged\\r\\nto. He treated that nice girl so badly. Kept putting things off. He has\\r\\nmarried a woman who was divorced. He’s so different from George. One\\r\\nwouldn’t think they could be brothers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter came and went by, and in earliest spring, before the glaze ice\\r\\nwas gone, Miss Willy fell. Anne came down one morning to find the\\r\\nkitchen cold. She called, opened the door of the old woman’s bedroom.\\r\\nThen throwing a shawl about her she went out of doors. At the door of\\r\\nthe hen-house she found her, huddled, eyes dim with pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, don’t you lift me,” said Willy, her lips blue, her face gray in\\r\\nthe sunlight. “Something’s broke.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sped across the road for the doctor and on for Dorilliam, who came\\r\\nrunning back with his father and a brother or two. They carried old\\r\\nWilly into the bedroom off the kitchen, and for an hour while young\\r\\nWarren shrieked unregarded Anne stood by and helped. When the worst of\\r\\nit was over Miss Willy’s lips quivered to a smile. Anne followed the\\r\\ndoctor out of doors. She was shaken and trembling. It was the first\\r\\ntime she had ever seen torture administered that healing might come.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, she’s not likely to die,” the doctor told her. “Of course she has\\r\\nworked pretty hard, but it’s amazing how much vitality there is in\\r\\nher sort. I’ve known bones to knit even at her age. But with a broken\\r\\nhip--well, she may get around some, after a time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time. Anne looked at him, pale. He patted her shoulder. “Don’t\\r\\nworry too much, Mrs. Denison,” he told her. “Whatever happens, you can\\r\\ncomfort yourself with one thing. It means a lot to Miss Willy to know\\r\\nyou are here. I shall never forget the light in her face the day she\\r\\ntold me her widowed niece had come to take care of her in her old age.\\r\\nThey so dread being a burden, these people. And they dread even more\\r\\nhaving to be taken care of by strangers, maybe to go on the town.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo take care of her. That brave lie told to shield Anne’s pride. She\\r\\nwent back to the kitchen. To take care of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBit by bit, Anne learned what that meant, to take care of someone. Day\\r\\nby day she learned what it had meant that old Willy had taken care of\\r\\nherself and the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings, unimagined things, things vaguely known about but never\\r\\nrealized, had to be done, and not by someone else whom she could\\r\\ndismiss from her thoughts with pay; elemental things, that she had\\r\\nalways taken for granted. The fire in the kitchen stove would not keep\\r\\nburning unless it were fed with some regularity. After a week that\\r\\nstove seemed to Anne like some ravenous maw that was always yawning,\\r\\nalways devouring, never to be satisfied. There were twenty-two steps\\r\\nfrom the wood-pile at the end of the shed, with a step up and a step\\r\\ndown each way. Twenty-two steps, to bring in coal or wood, that Miss\\r\\nWilly, at seventy-four, had trod how many times a day? There was food\\r\\nto be cooked, food that mysteriously scorched, or came from the stove\\r\\nas mysteriously hard. Water, the pump over the kitchen sink the only\\r\\nmeans of getting it. How had old Willy ever, oh, ever carried all those\\r\\npails and pitchers of water upstairs and down again, for Anne’s needs\\r\\nand Warren’s? And she had always thought of water and food and fire\\r\\nquite simply as things that were, that existed, like air and sunlight,\\r\\nmade for man’s use, and there waiting, simply, infallibly there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there was time. Hitherto time had been divided into a few\\r\\nbroad parts, bed-time and rising-time, breakfast- and luncheon- and\\r\\ndinner-time; or, at Miss Willy’s, dinner- and supper-time. Now there\\r\\nwere many bewildering subdivisions, and one had to hasten to meet them\\r\\nbefore their requirements or demands or whatever they were used for\\r\\nslipped over into another of the strange subdivisions, disastrously.\\r\\nTime to get up--oh, yes, but time also to make the fire, time to get it\\r\\nto going, time to get the stove hot and the breakfast cooked, time for\\r\\nyoung Warren’s increasing needs, while in her consciousness was always\\r\\nthe fact that Miss Willy lay, patient, waiting, perhaps suffering.\\r\\nThere were hens and the chicks to be fed, then a rushing for dinner.\\r\\nAnd in between, where there was not room to crowd a single second’s\\r\\nendeavor, a whole multitude of tasks that must somehow be got through.\\r\\nCleaning. And washing. What those things did to her back, so much\\r\\nyounger than Willy’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s awful, you having to do everything,” Miss Willy said to her one\\r\\nday when she brought the boy into the room all fresh and rosy from\\r\\nhis bath. She had got up at five that morning, but things were still\\r\\nwaiting. Yet she looked down at Willy and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is. It is, isn’t it? Because I’m such a duffer at it, Willykin. You\\r\\ndon’t know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy did not laugh with her. Her lips trembled. “But if you\\r\\nwasn’t here, Anne, I’d--maybe I’d have to--go on--the town.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne put the boy on the floor--he was beginning to creep about--and sat\\r\\non the side of the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Willy,” she said, “something is happening to me. I don’t know what it\\r\\nis. But I think I was never so happy in my life nor so disgusted with\\r\\nmyself. I do hate to see you lying there, but I think perhaps your\\r\\nbreaking your funny old bones was just your last fine sacrifice for me.\\r\\nI think----”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was too much for old Willy. Her eyes struck dim fire. “Now\\r\\nlook here, Annie Warren,” said she, with the first return of her old\\r\\nspirit that she had shown since her fall, “if you think the Lord’s put\\r\\nme here so’s you can get hold of a mite of sense, you’re mistaken.\\r\\nThat’s putting too much on the Lord. I slipped on the ice because I\\r\\nwasn’t looking out. That’s what did it. My own fault. But I do say it’s\\r\\nhigh time you knew how to do things. Not that I should want you to tire\\r\\nyourself out. And--my goodness! Quick! Look at that child! He’ll be on\\r\\nthe stove in a minute!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne flew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were days, a while later, when she got up at four, when to stay\\r\\nin bed would have been sheer unwarrantable luxury, though her body\\r\\nstill ached for rest and she told herself that she could not go through\\r\\nwith the work ahead of her. Yet she arose, and the day’s work caught\\r\\nher up, whirled her on with it, herself not the force that accomplished\\r\\nbut the means, the mere tool of that force.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen spring reluctantly gave way to summer people in Heathville hastily\\r\\nmade their gardens. It was not safe to plant earlier lest the tender\\r\\ngreen shoots be nipped by late frost, nor later lest the first hot\\r\\nspell of June wither them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Memorial Day, that’s the right time to plant,” said old Deacon Bassett\\r\\nwho lived up the road. “You ain’t likely to get caught either goin’ or\\r\\ncomin’.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDorilliam had done the plowing, the spading, the leveling. Anne had\\r\\nsupposed that Dorilliam would do all the rest. She had never felt\\r\\ninterested in gardening, and now her time was too full to contemplate\\r\\nadded work out of doors. But she sat at the kitchen table one night\\r\\nwith pencil and paper after paying Dorilliam, her pocket-book open,\\r\\nwhat remained of its contents spread out before her. There had to be\\r\\nextra milk now, quarts of it, for young Warren. Oranges, too, that now\\r\\nhad become not the inevitable breakfast fruit, but a daily expense\\r\\nof five cents, ten cents, a staggering total each month. The boy was\\r\\nbeginning to walk; the delicate shoes she sent to town for wore out in\\r\\na few weeks. Old Willy had always done their washing. That Anne was\\r\\nincapable of, and it had to be paid for. Moreover, she had discovered\\r\\nthe extreme meagerness of the old woman’s supply of bedding and towels,\\r\\nand had bought more. Pity she had not thought of bringing some from\\r\\nthat house whose contents she had never wanted to see again. The people\\r\\nwho had rented it at first had departed. The next tenants had wanted\\r\\nit unfurnished, and she had insisted that everything should be sent\\r\\nto the auction rooms, everything, everything. She wanted nothing, no\\r\\nreminders. They brought a small fraction of what they had cost. At old\\r\\nWilly’s command, for it was more than suggestion, the little sum had\\r\\nbeen deposited in a savings bank, to be used for the boy’s education.\\r\\nThat could not be touched. With herself as housekeeper, more was\\r\\nspent than under old Willy’s close management for food and fuel. Even\\r\\nkerosene had to be bought oftener. And now loomed the question of the\\r\\ngarden. Anne counted her money, tried to estimate the hours during the\\r\\nsummer that she would need Dorilliam, added up what that would cost,\\r\\ndeducted. It could not be done. She spoke of it to Willy, the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve decided that we won’t have a garden this year, dear,” said she.\\r\\n“I’m no gardener. You know that. We’ll just do without.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment the old woman lay without looking at Anne, without\\r\\nspeaking. Her face against the pillow was wrinkled and pallid. Her age\\r\\nmight have been beyond computing, like the Sphinx’s, and as silently\\r\\nas the Sphinx she might have been pondering the proposition implied in\\r\\nAnne’s words. Then she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’ll we eat?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, anything, everything,” Anne said lightly, even while an inner\\r\\nsense warned her that the question was not a light one. “There’s always\\r\\nsomething to eat, isn’t there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what?” Willy persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no question as tormenting as the one which puts its solution\\r\\non the questioner. Old Willy lay looking impassively at a crack in the\\r\\nwall, but Anne looked at Willy. “There is always something to eat,\\r\\nisn’t there?” she had asked. But was there? Food. Food, the elemental,\\r\\nprimal, ultimate necessity. Was it indeed always there? She thought of\\r\\nher pocket-book, her sheets of figuring. The thing faced her, simply,\\r\\nstarkly, naked, stripped of everything, as hideous and uncompromising\\r\\nas a skeleton: was food always there? What would they eat? Where would\\r\\nit come from?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was breath-taking, bewildering. She busied herself again and again\\r\\nwith her pencil and paper, then consulted Dorilliam. Something, some\\r\\nremote shame or pride, forbade her from talking to Willy. That old\\r\\nwoman lying there, who had met this problem so many years, now so\\r\\nhelpless, probably thinking and thinking, perhaps worrying. No. If she\\r\\nhad the thing to go through with, she would do it alone, for Dorilliam\\r\\ndid not count as a person except in the sense of being a workman of\\r\\nsorts and of having to be paid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you want to buy seeds for?” he asked, when she asked him as\\r\\ncasually as she could what she would need to buy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To plant in the garden,” said she, sternly. She was always suspecting\\r\\nthat Dorilliam held her in secret amusement and scorn, as those\\r\\ncountrymen do who know a few things beyond the scope of someone they\\r\\nconfront, and believe their knowledge surpasses all of the others. But\\r\\nthe boy was honestly puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah. But what you want to buy ’em for? Why don’t you plant what you\\r\\ngot?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I have?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure. She’s got ’em saved up, ain’t she? Everybody saves ’em up for\\r\\nnext year.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo after all she spoke to Willy again about the garden, went to the\\r\\nplace where Willy had stored the saved seeds, in jars and small packets\\r\\ntied about with bits of string. Economy had never held anything of\\r\\nbeauty for Anne, but when she brought out those seeds, fruit of an\\r\\nold woman’s toil, so carefully cured and saved that the soil might be\\r\\nfruitful again the next year, something gripped at her throat. Here was\\r\\na poignant significance that rose up at her. Here, too, was the germ\\r\\nof a new perception. The garden was made and tended that they might\\r\\nhave something to eat. As simple as that. But there was more in it than\\r\\nthat stark necessity. It was the child of other gardens. In the little\\r\\npackets of saved seeds there was not only harvest, but a link with\\r\\ngardens of other summers, with summers to come, as old Willy’s toil was\\r\\nlinked with the labor of the ages, as her own would be. On and on, the\\r\\ntreadmill, unending, however one ached. And after she had talked with\\r\\nWilly as to methods and means, she was confronted with her stupendous\\r\\nignorance of what seemed so simple, what was, indeed, so elemental.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, you just scrape out a row, and put ’em into it,” said Willy.\\r\\n“Then you cover ’em up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With what?” she asked, for she had seen newspapers carefully spread\\r\\nover some of the old woman’s tender “cuttings” and wondered if that\\r\\nwere a rite to be observed with everything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good land, child, ain’t you got any sense at all? You cover ’em up\\r\\nwith dirt, and pat ’em all down, of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed a little. “Do they have to be patted? Shall I pull up the\\r\\nblankets and hear them say their prayers, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWilly sniffed. “You don’t have to blaspheme just because you’re so\\r\\nignorant,” said she, “though lots of folks do. Yes, they do have to\\r\\nbe patted, or else trod on. The dirt’s got to touch ’em, or else they\\r\\nwon’t sprout. And the dirt’s got to be fine, not all lumps. Sakes\\r\\nalive, I wish I could get out o’ this bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s sheer pride and jealousy, Willy. You think I can’t make this\\r\\ngarden, and you want to do it yourself,” Anne laughed. But when she\\r\\nconfronted the actual task she did not laugh. Before, she felt herself\\r\\npotentially able to cope with it. It must be quite simple, like driving\\r\\na Ford, because people of such inferior intelligence mastered it. Of\\r\\ncourse it was not fit work for her, and she had not a minute to spare\\r\\nfor it. But it must be easy enough, since even an old woman like Willy\\r\\nhad accomplished it. Her only difficulty would be in finding time.\\r\\nSo one morning she got up at four, just as dawn was flushing on the\\r\\nwestern hills, and betook herself to the place Dorilliam had raked at\\r\\nsuch a cost. Scrape out a row, Willy had said, and make the dirt fine.\\r\\nEasy, until her shoulders ached with the weight of the hoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer row turned out to be a wandering path of varying depth. She dropped\\r\\nin the seeds. Willy had said there were enough in the bundle for a\\r\\nwhole row, but they mysteriously gave out before the row was half\\r\\nfilled. She considered the problem, carefully picked out seeds enough\\r\\nfor the rest of the row. Then came the affair of making the dirt fine,\\r\\nto cover them with. She could not. It was heavy with dew, refused to\\r\\ncrumble, persisted in becoming a tough, clayey substance under her\\r\\nhands. She had been out two hours, Warren’s cries could be heard, she\\r\\nwas aching and angry. She had not achieved one single row in this\\r\\nmiserable garden, and the piece of smoothed land stretched before her\\r\\ninto a leering expanse as broad as an ocean. It was the first time she\\r\\nhad ever discovered that to work with nature one must use nature’s\\r\\ntime, wait on her moods. When she went to the garden again, later in\\r\\nthe day, she was amazed to find that the earth crumbled easily enough.\\r\\nThereafter she rose at the same early hour, but worked at other things\\r\\nuntil the garden was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks later, again directed by one of Deacon Bassett’s\\r\\npronouncements, she was working there with a hoe, the baby happy and\\r\\nnoisy, playing in the dirt, his attention absorbed by filling a tin\\r\\ncan with a hole in the bottom, watching the soil sift out, and filling\\r\\nthe can again. Someone spoke to him over the fence. Anne looked up\\r\\nand nodded, but Warren deserted his game and promptly performed the\\r\\nacrobatic feat of making himself into a small pyramid, bracing his\\r\\nfeet until they were steady by resting his hands on the ground, his\\r\\ninevitable method of arising. Then he toddled and tumbled towards\\r\\nDorilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s them things for?” Dorilliam presently asked. He had come near,\\r\\nholding Warren’s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat back, wearily, but with a sense of triumph, too. “Them things”\\r\\nwere an achievement, and she took pride in making them well, first by\\r\\nscraping the earth up with a hoe, then rounding it off with her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re the hills for the corn, of course,” said she. “This is the\\r\\nweek for corn. What should they be?” She rather enjoyed snubbing\\r\\nDorilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dunno,” said the boy. “Never saw nothing like ’em before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you’ve lived in the country all your life. I’m surprised at you.\\r\\nMr. Bassett says it’s much better to plant corn in hills than in rows.\\r\\nIt doesn’t blow over as easily.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDorilliam’s slow grin was a thing to see. “Here, you gimme that hoe,”\\r\\nsaid he, and forsook Warren’s hand so abruptly that the baby sat down\\r\\nwith a soft thud. Dorilliam scraped out a shallow hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now that,” said he, “is a hill. You put your corn in there on top.\\r\\nThen you cover it over. Then you stomp on it. That’s the way to plant\\r\\ncorn. Them things you made, they ain’t hills. They’re Mount Ararats.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My goodness,” Anne murmured, meekly. “A hill upside down.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the incident gave her a new feeling of humility, of helplessness,\\r\\nof respect: humility, that she, Anne Denison, should cope so badly\\r\\nwith such primitive affairs; helplessness, because there seemed so\\r\\nmany difficulties, however absurd and small; respect for these country\\r\\npeople, even for Dorilliam, that they could perform with ease what she\\r\\nfound so intricate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before the last row was planted and walked on there were green\\r\\nthings beginning to show in the first ones. By that time she had formed\\r\\nquite a friendship with the Deacon, a stern, gray old man. Often after\\r\\nsupper he would come down the road to inspect her labors. Sometimes,\\r\\nwhen a new problem came up, she would tuck Warren under her arm and run\\r\\nto Bassett’s house for advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” she complacently told him one evening, “they’re coming along.”\\r\\nThat was a phrase he used; she had unconsciously adopted it. “And I do\\r\\nthink Miss Willy’s seeds are wonderful. Ever so many more come up than\\r\\nI’ve planted, it seems to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBassett rubbed his chin. He shaved on Sundays only. “Yeus. Well,\\r\\nmebbe,” said he. “But I shouldn’t be s’prised if a good many of those\\r\\ngreen shoots are weeds. I s’ppose you ain’t got around to weedin’ yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat, when she had begun to tell herself that her labors were all but\\r\\nover. She thought of her aching arms, of tasks waiting indoors, thought\\r\\nyearningly of Dorilliam. But old Willy had managed without the boy. So\\r\\nwould she. Many an evening after she had washed the day’s grime from\\r\\nWarren and got him to sleep, and laundered some of his small garments,\\r\\nand made the kitchen neat after supper, she worked on her knees between\\r\\nthe rows, weeding until it was too dark to see. Yet do what she might,\\r\\nthere were disasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seems like our beet-greens is terrible slow, this year,” said Miss\\r\\nWilly. “You got ’em in in time, too. It’s funny, what a difference\\r\\nthere is in seasons.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNo need to tell her that all the young beets had been carefully,\\r\\nlaboriously, back-breakingly weeded up. And such futile things, anyway,\\r\\nbeet-greens. To get the best of one, merely by being. It shamed her,\\r\\nthat difficulty of coping with little things that she had scarcely\\r\\nrealized existed except as insignificant parts of a whole that ordered\\r\\nitself. She had always been willing to battle with what she conceived\\r\\nto be big things, those that meant conflict with people. There was\\r\\nexhilaration in that. It got one somewhere. But this daily, hurrying\\r\\nconflict with nature and the bare routine of living was bewildering.\\r\\nIt entangled her in all sorts of complicated trivialities, as though\\r\\nit could make any difference, for example, whether one planted corn in\\r\\nrows or in holes or on small Mount Ararats. To find that it did make a\\r\\ndifference, that one had to discover and yield to the preferences of\\r\\ncorn and of beans, was bewildering.\\r\\n\\r\\nBewildering; but slowly out of bewilderment there came a feeling of\\r\\nconducting a campaign. She was not going to let herself be conquered\\r\\nby a vegetable garden. It grew in importance, became a battle-ground.\\r\\nEventually, victorious, she had such a feeling of triumph and\\r\\nachievement as not even the arrival of Warren had given her,--Wanny,\\r\\nthat small-featured replica of Brice. The garden with all its failures\\r\\nand oddities, not in the least like Miss Willy’s neat, straight-rowed\\r\\none, was a thing of her own creating, wrought by her own labor, by the\\r\\nveritable sweat of her brow and the grime of her hands and the ache of\\r\\nher body, something that contributed to the very foundation of life,\\r\\nsomething, quite simply, to eat. It was as though she had caused earth\\r\\nor air or water to come into existence. She had caused food to be. She\\r\\ndid not regard her performance nor its results as beautiful, nor as\\r\\nclever, nor as amusing, nor as something bound up with the future, like\\r\\nWanny. She had brought something that was elemental out of nothingness.\\r\\nShe had become creative of that which was the very basis of existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the summer passed in toil. No time for thoughts, nor for thought.\\r\\nNo time, really, for anything, with so much to be done, so little that\\r\\ncould be left undone. Hens, Anne discovered, could be as clamorous as\\r\\nbabies. When a prideful, clucking absurdity emerged from a hidden nest\\r\\nwith a brood of chicks she could have crushed the lot of them. They\\r\\nwere hated, but they were important, for they were food, and after a\\r\\nday or two their very helplessness and dependency captured her. She was\\r\\nindignant and sorrowful when one fell prey to Buster’s rapaciousness.\\r\\nMiss Willy frequently asked after her flowers. There were weeds among\\r\\nthem that Anne told herself could not go unregarded, whatever happened.\\r\\nThe peonies bloomed so generously. How could she let their brave beauty\\r\\nsmother in weeds? After a summer rain, the hollyhocks lay on the\\r\\nground. There was no time for it, but she must find stakes, tie them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midsummer Wanny was toddling everywhere. He possessed an ingenuity\\r\\nfor getting into mischief beyond anything his mother had ever\\r\\nencountered. If he were silent or out of sight for too long she had\\r\\nto drop everything, hunt for him. And his clothes, those small costly\\r\\nshoes that wore out so soon, the rompers that had to be fresh every\\r\\nmorning. There were days when his bath was no more than a hasty\\r\\nsponging away of grime before he was put to sleep, nights when she was\\r\\nso weary that she dropped on her bed without undressing, to wake in the\\r\\ndawn with a crowding sense of things waiting to be done, in a panic of\\r\\nfear lest she had over-slept. Everything was in the present. The future\\r\\nwas something she had no time to think about. Work. Two to care for,\\r\\nthree to provide for, hurriedly, rather chaotically.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter came, when she had thought there would be more time. But again\\r\\nthere were stoves, lamps, sewing. The child had outgrown the first\\r\\nbaby coat Alice had sent. Anne contrived to make him another out of an\\r\\nold skirt of her own. It had no air of elegance. She laughed when she\\r\\ndressed him in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pitty, pitty,” said Warren, smoothing his bulging front.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not so very pretty, old man,” Anne laughed. “But it will keep you\\r\\nwarm.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretty is as pretty does,” said old Willy, and Anne, “Goodness, I hope\\r\\nnot. If his looks had to be measured by his behavior----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years before she could not have tolerated that garment. Now she\\r\\ncould laugh at it, was even rather proud of it. But she did not for\\r\\nmore than a moment think of the change in herself. There was something\\r\\nelse waiting to be done. Orderliness she had not begun to learn. There\\r\\nwere neighbor women who came to see Miss Willy, bringing gifts of pies\\r\\nand doughnuts and “tastes” of jelly and jam and pickles. Seeing Miss\\r\\nWilly’s enjoyment of the delicacies, Anne remembered that the old woman\\r\\nhad always managed to put up some of her own. Now the pantry shelves\\r\\nheld none. She had never thought of making any. Where had Willy found\\r\\ntime to do it? How did those other women, busy mothers of families,\\r\\nfind time? Even the mere thought of their dish-washing staggered Anne’s\\r\\nimagination, now that she knew how mysteriously dishes piled up for\\r\\nonly three. And there was their mending, their cooking, their washing.\\r\\nYet those over-worked women found time to come to Miss Willy’s and\\r\\n“visit” sometimes for an hour or more. Anne found herself listening\\r\\nto their talk. It was no longer of trivialities beyond or beneath her\\r\\nscope and her interest; it was of things become vital. They had been\\r\\nvague, dull, toiling creatures without imagination, without grace,\\r\\nuninteresting. Now they emerged into separate entities, personalities\\r\\nwith feelings and impulses which she recognized, more skilled and\\r\\nexperienced than herself in things of first importance. There was so\\r\\nmuch that they knew and that she did not, and things they achieved\\r\\ndaily, as a matter of course, simply and neatly, that staggered her\\r\\nefforts and ingenuity to perform and left her worn with fatigue after\\r\\ntrying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The working classes”--she remembered that she used to think of the\\r\\nworking classes, in the old days, with something akin to disgust.\\r\\nShe had never been able to understand Nicky’s interest in them, nor\\r\\nhow she had been able to endure daily contact with them. Either they\\r\\ntoiled with an impenetrable, ineffectual, stolid indifference, or\\r\\nthey disagreeably or violently protested against their lot, deviously\\r\\ntrying to better it at the cost of the comfort of people who were more\\r\\nfortunate than themselves. They were unreasonably envious, and their\\r\\nmorals were as sordid as their way of living. She had always felt\\r\\ninjured and angry when one of her maids had asked for extra time off.\\r\\nShe remembered her amused scorn when they spent their earnings for some\\r\\nfoolish finery to be worn on one or two afternoons of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese women who dropped in to see Willy were toilers in a labor\\r\\nunending. She knew about that, now. As far as she could perceive,\\r\\ntheirs was a labor without result or reward, just a grind, day after\\r\\nday, year after year. Now she knew that they were not sunk in a dull\\r\\nstate of mental and spiritual stagnation. They were not clamorously\\r\\ntrying to better their lot at the expense of others. Apparently they\\r\\nshattered no more of the Ten Commandments than anyone else did.\\r\\nSometimes she wondered what secret revolts of the soul might be\\r\\ntheirs, or whether they had souls at all in the sense of possessing\\r\\na well-spring of feeling and thought and aspiration. They concerned\\r\\nthemselves with things she had never supposed required thought or were\\r\\nbound up with feeling or led to aspiration, but indubitably aspiration\\r\\nand feeling and thought played a part in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first they had been shy with her. One or two had told her\\r\\nhesitatingly how fine it was for Miss Willy to have her there. They\\r\\nthought of her as the niece from the city who went about always dressed\\r\\nup and sat around while Miss Willy waited on her. Now they found her\\r\\naproned, busy, and there was always the child to talk about. Anne found\\r\\nherself listening with absorbed interest to tales of other children’s\\r\\nillnesses. She was not bored when Mrs. Ware told how her Julia had\\r\\nbroken her collar-bone, nor when Mrs. Beaman told how her twins in one\\r\\nwinter had measles and chicken pox and whooping cough, alternately,\\r\\n“so’s we were no sooner gettin’ out o’ one thing with Elizabeth than we\\r\\ncome down with the same thing with Florence; and by the time Florence\\r\\nwas better, Elizabeth had started on something else.” Those things\\r\\nwere not trivial. They were not disgusting. They were not unpleasant\\r\\ndiseases that troublesome children persisted in having, so that one\\r\\nwondered how mothers endured them. They were dangers that lurked for\\r\\nWanny. Those women were mothers. So was she.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took Wanny to the Christmas tree at the church. His round-eyed\\r\\nwonder was a revelation, something that pierced to her heart. Mrs.\\r\\nBeaman gave him an orange. When he held it in both hands, stared at it,\\r\\nit was not an orange, but a symbol, a mystery. He had seen it taken\\r\\nfrom a box under the tree. Therefore it was endued with beauties and\\r\\nwonders beyond all other oranges. Anne, looking up, met Mrs. Beaman’s\\r\\nglance, her tolerant, understanding smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days thereafter Mrs. Wells ran down the road bearing a plate\\r\\nwrapped up in a napkin. Hot rolls. “I thought maybe they’d go good for\\r\\nsupper,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Land! I should think so,” old Willy said. “We ain’t had any home-made\\r\\nbread since I don’t know when.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitor looked at Anne. “Why, you don’t buy all your bread, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t make it,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it costs so much at the store.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Anne bundled up Wanny and walked up the road to the\\r\\nBassetts’s. The children of that house had long ago gone away, the old\\r\\ncouple were alone, and Mrs. Bassett was known as the best housekeeper\\r\\nin Heathville, eternally busy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you teach me how to make bread?” Anne asked, and could see the\\r\\nflattered look in the old woman’s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first loaves were an achievement that gave her a satisfaction\\r\\nscarcely less than her conquest of the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that I smell?” old Willy called out, from the bedroom. “You\\r\\nain’t ever trying to make bread, child! You’ll just waste the flour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not I,” Anne declared, coming in with a freshly baked loaf turned out\\r\\non a towel. “Look at that! Willy, when I think of the money we’ve spent\\r\\nat that store for bread----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Willy’s lips quivered. “I got to get out o’ this bed,” said she.\\r\\n“You can’t do all the work yourself, and takin’ on more all the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne put the loaf down, came and stood near the bed. “Willy,” she said,\\r\\n“it’s the strangest thing. No matter how much more I find to do, I\\r\\nalways seem to find time to do it in. And stranger still, I rather like\\r\\ndoing it. It makes me feel so important.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually the women who had been coming to see Miss Willy lingered to\\r\\nchat with Anne. Recipes were given, that had to be explained. Flower\\r\\nseeds were brought in small bits of brown paper, and about their\\r\\nflowers odd sentiments lingered, odd to Anne because at first they\\r\\nseemed so trivial.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s ‘Impatience,’” said one, presenting a slim sprig of green\\r\\nplanted in a can from which the label had been removed. “‘Impatience,’\\r\\nthough some folks call it ‘Patience’. Either way it’s the truth, for\\r\\nit’s always in a hurry to bloom, and it blooms all the time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were slips of geranium, too, and a small, prickly cactus.\\r\\nAnne thought of Alice’s masses of flowers, of those she herself had\\r\\nalways managed to buy for the dining-room, and of lilacs and orchids,\\r\\nand tulips; Tulips that fell. But these little struggling things in\\r\\npots and cans had personality, identity. They were a nuisance at\\r\\nfirst, because she was forever forgetting to water them; but when she\\r\\ndiscovered them drooping, and watched for them to revive, they assumed\\r\\nan importance beyond reason. They were gifts. She could not let them\\r\\ndie. Then they bloomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time spring came again Miss Willy was hobbling about with a\\r\\ncrutch and a cane. The crutch Anne had to buy. That month she began to\\r\\ndo their washing. The cane was brought out of a chest in the attic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My poor grandfather’s cane,” said Miss Willy. “You can see his name\\r\\non the silver band. Poor man. I’m afraid he drank a good deal. My\\r\\ngrandmother married again. But after all, I’m sure there’s nothing like\\r\\nyoung love, my dear. I’ve been thinking. When Wanny grows up----”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Willy was almost herself once more, though she was never again able\\r\\nto do active work. She could sit in the window behind the flowers and\\r\\nsew, and knit stockings for Warren. It lifted a good deal from Anne to\\r\\nhave her watch the boy, whose capacity for mischief increased every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What that child does think up,” said Willy. He had climbed on a chair\\r\\nwhen no one was looking and dropped soap into a stew Anne was making\\r\\nfor dinner. They discovered it when he danced up and down, clapping his\\r\\nhands and shouting:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, ’ook at the bubbles! ’ook at the bubbles on the stove! Pretty\\r\\nbubbles! Wanny makes ooooh pretty bubbles!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, from the chair where his mother had forcefully deposited him,\\r\\nhe howled miserably. “Don’t like Wanny’s bubbles! Bad Mums don’t like\\r\\nWanny’s bubbles!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked dolefully at Willy. “Stew enough for two days. Oh dear! All\\r\\nthat good meat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy’s placidity was not ruffled. “He was only just doing what\\r\\nyou do yourself, and what most folks do,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never put soap in the stew,” Anne protested, laughing ruefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ain’t so sure about that. But what I meant was he only sees things\\r\\nfrom where he stands. You got to make allowances for that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the months Anne had achieved some measure of\\r\\norderliness. Work did not crowd as much as before. She found herself\\r\\nlooking forward with unsuspected eagerness to the time when the garden\\r\\ncould be planted. It was good to see the snows melting, good to see the\\r\\nbrown earth emerging and drying, good to bring in pussy-willows and\\r\\nto wander with Warren through the moist woods to find hepaticas, even\\r\\ngood to hear the hylas again. One night when the others were asleep\\r\\nshe stood at her window and looked out. The moon was high. Earth and\\r\\nsky were inherent parts of the same beauty, hesitant, translucent. In\\r\\nthe moonlight even the familiar garden and roads and fields wore an\\r\\neffect of luminous unreality. The world slept, yet it was breathing\\r\\nand dreaming. It called her to go forth into its hesitant loveliness,\\r\\nto penetrate and become a part of its dream. The boy was sleeping\\r\\nwith his face buried in his pillow, the red curls on his neck damp and\\r\\nsweet. He could be trusted not to wake. She crept down the stairs. The\\r\\ndoors were never locked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was strange to be walking along the road in this strange light. Even\\r\\nthe shadows were softer, melting and merging into the earth. On and on\\r\\nshe walked, slowly, through a world creating itself anew, through sweet\\r\\nwoods, between fields fragrant with the moist breath of night, past a\\r\\nmarsh where the hylas piped, little Pans, plaintive, luring, singing of\\r\\njoys that might be or joys to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbruptly, where the road wound through a stretch of woods, she stopped.\\r\\nSomething moved there. Once fear would have held her, but she had come\\r\\nto know how needless fear was in that far-away countryside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope I have not frightened you?” a voice asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange, to hear again a voice of cultivation, words enunciated with\\r\\ncareless precision. Suddenly she remembered. Not far beyond was the\\r\\nhouse of the man who had come out to the doctor’s car on the day it had\\r\\nstalled, the man the doctor termed “old fool.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not exactly,” she said, quietly. “I’m afraid I have walked rather\\r\\nfarther than I meant to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had come nearer. He was hatless, and she remembered how white his\\r\\nhair had looked that day, and realized that its whiteness gave him that\\r\\nstrange appearance now in the dim light.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. One has to come out on a night like this,” he said. “I’ve an\\r\\nidea that the real purpose of the moon is to keep the balance even. The\\r\\nsun works. The moon calms and blesses. We need both work and calm, to\\r\\nkeep the balance true.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled faintly. How odd he was, to speak like that, without\\r\\npreface, to a stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are various other things one needs, are there not?” she\\r\\nsuggested, falling into his mood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Oh, yes. But they all come into the two categories. Work, not\\r\\nnecessarily what one does not love or enjoy, but work, occupation. And\\r\\ncalm. ‘Ease and alternate labor.’ What else is there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had fallen into step. After a moment she said, “I think you are\\r\\nlaughing at me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grasped at a bough that projected across the road, its buds just\\r\\nbeginning to open, snapped it off, the sound of its breaking distinct\\r\\nin the night’s stillness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forgive me. Not at you. I should not have said that. Nor felt it.\\r\\nIt’s only fair that life should give us the obvious things, make us go\\r\\nsearching for the others.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So there is something else?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew he turned to look at her. “You came out to find it, didn’t\\r\\nyou? And I came out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on a little. “Does one find, I wonder?” she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the edge of the woods. Before them a meadow lay\\r\\nflooded with moonlight, gleaming like a sea becalmed. They stood\\r\\nstill, held by its beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” he said presently. “But if one may still search, still\\r\\ncome out, into this!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s beautiful,” she said softly. “But there’s no answer there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not so sure. Not that it matters, the answer. It’s the search, the\\r\\nfact that one can come out, that one wants to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that enough?” Unconsciously they spoke almost in whispers, as\\r\\nthough to speak aloud would be to break the spell of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not enough, no. But there’s always the belief or the hope that there’s\\r\\nsomething to be found. Else one would not come out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, we all wonder. But we all know it’s there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waited. “Rhythm, I think. Or call it God.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent a moment. Then, without seeming to know she was there,\\r\\nhe walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day she permitted Miss Willy to go as far as the garden Anne\\r\\nproudly pointed. “There!” she exclaimed. “Look at that, all ready for\\r\\nthe seeds. I did it myself, too. Dorilliam did nothing but the plowing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wanny helped,” the youngster boasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the hoeing and raking! You never did, Anne Warren!” old Willy\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed, brushed a hand upward across her damp forehead. “But I\\r\\ndid. I’m so proud of it. I call that a good job well done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter received from Alice about that time amused her. Alice and\\r\\nGeorge were taking the children to Europe for the summer. Would not\\r\\nAnne use their house while they were gone? The servants would be there,\\r\\nthe house going on as usual. There would be the car, and Warren would\\r\\nlike the children’s playthings, the sand-pile and swing in the yard.\\r\\nThere was plenty of room for Miss Willy, too. Anne’s first thought was,\\r\\n“Why, I couldn’t leave the garden!” Then she laughed aloud. But it was\\r\\nquite true. That garden had been conquered the year before. Now it was\\r\\nhers, and she could not tolerate the thought of leaving it. That summer\\r\\nthere were no such mistakes as had baffled her last year, for old Willy\\r\\nlooked on and advised. Anne was bending over the wash-tubs every week,\\r\\nrejoicing in the flapping white things on the line. She was making\\r\\ntheir bread, and under Willy’s direction canning fruits and young\\r\\ntender vegetables in glass jars for winter. Warren, with his increased\\r\\ncapacity for getting out of sight and into mischief, was even more care\\r\\nthan before. Yet she had an elated consciousness of living.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne July day when the heat was so intense that Willy had not ventured\\r\\nout of doors, Anne was hanging out clothes, grateful that the weekly\\r\\nwashing was done. The old woman came to the kitchen door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wanny with you?” she called.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne put the last clothes-pin in place, took up her basket. “That\\r\\nmonkey! Has he slipped off again? I’ll have to go look for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went, calling, and presently Warren came running towards her, his\\r\\nface mottled with crimson, torn with briers, and both his closed fists\\r\\ndripping red. But he was smiling angelically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I brought you some, too, Mums,” said he, opening his hands and holding\\r\\nthem up to her. He had been tightly grasping the raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He ought to be spanked,” said Miss Willy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked over the child’s head, and smiled. He was standing in one\\r\\nof the tubs getting scoured, his dimpled body rising from the suds in\\r\\nwhich he was infinitely more interested than in cleanliness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you do the spanking?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy looked at her over her spectacles, said not a word more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon the child was sleepy. His forehead was hot. “Don’t want\\r\\nto go out in the garden. Want to stay here,” he said later, and Anne,\\r\\nwho was starting the fire for supper, absently agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, old man. But don’t get in mother’s way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she heard a cry from Miss Willy. Another moment and she was\\r\\nkneeling on the floor, lifting the child to her breast, shrieking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop that! Leave him there! Don’t take him up! It’s a spasm,” she\\r\\nheard Willy say.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s dying! My baby’s dying!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He ain’t, either! You leave him right there, and run for the doctor.\\r\\nI’ll get the kettle on. Give me a spoon to put in his mouth. Now\\r\\nrun----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little body was stiff, the child’s eyes rolled upward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If the doctor ain’t there, get Mis’ Beaman,” Willy called after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stumbled on the steps, caught herself, raced on. The doctor was\\r\\nnot there. Mrs. Beaman turned from the stove, the twins and the other\\r\\nchildren staring open-mouthed at the frantic woman who had burst in\\r\\nupon them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My baby! Convulsions--he’s dying,” Anne panted.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly Mrs. Beaman grasped a steaming tea-kettle from the stove and\\r\\nheld it towards Anne. “Take that and run,” said she. “Here you, Johnny,\\r\\nyou carry this pot. Never mind the potatoes in it, they won’t do any\\r\\nharm. Now I’ll get the mustard----”\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes, half an hour, and Wanny was wrapped in a blanket, relaxed,\\r\\nhis eyes closed. Mrs. Beaman laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I used to think you used a good many things to bathe him with, when he\\r\\nwas a baby,” she said, “but I guess it’s the first time he ever had a\\r\\nhot bath with potatoes floating around in the water.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was still trembling. “If you hadn’t come! You saved my boy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in August Nicky came for a week. She watched Anne at first\\r\\ncuriously, making no comment on her varied activities. Human work in\\r\\nthe garden was over until time for harvesting. There were hours in the\\r\\nlong afternoons when the two could sit in the shade or walk through the\\r\\nwoods.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne,” Veronica asked one day, “do you ever have time to think?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. “Yes, with my hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never seen you look so happy, so satisfied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why shouldn’t I be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That, from Nance Denison! But you aren’t Nance Denison.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne leaned forward, her hands dropped beyond her knees. “Oh, yes I am.\\r\\nDon’t you think I am not, Nicky old girl. I always wanted to do things,\\r\\nmy own things, have my own way. Now I’m doing them, reveling in having\\r\\nmy own way. Of course I’m happy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And satisfied?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well, that! There always has to be something beyond. Of course I’m\\r\\nnot going to stay here forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s really what I came about, Nance.” Anne looked at her\\r\\nquestioningly. “There’s a new home for working girls. A sort of hotel,\\r\\nreally, but they want to provide something more for the girls than\\r\\nother homes do. They want a hostess, a woman who has been used to\\r\\nthings. I can get you the job if you want it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s Wanny.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You could have Wanny with you. The pay isn’t bad.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stood up, her hands behind her back. There was the garden, the\\r\\nhouse, the hen-house, the hills and ripening fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nicky, I can’t,” she said. “Not while old Willy lives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky lay back, stretched her arms over her head, yawned. “You’re\\r\\ngrowing up, Anne,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, Anne wondered at herself a little. It was true that a few\\r\\nyears before she would have taken the chance without thinking of anyone\\r\\nwho stood in the way. If she had heard of some other woman making such\\r\\na choice she would have scorned her for it, set her down in the same\\r\\ncategory into which she had dismissed people like those who were now\\r\\nher neighbors, as being of no account, bound by their own dullness\\r\\nand stupidity and lack of initiative, without intention, without\\r\\naspiration. Her mind was still groping. She could not have told why\\r\\nshe had permitted herself to be held by allegiance to old Willy. But,\\r\\nhowever vaguely, she was beginning to feel that there was something\\r\\nbeyond initiative and aspiration, some established necessary sequence,\\r\\nperhaps even some purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral times she had encountered the man Kent on the road or in the\\r\\nstore. Once he had said to Warren:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You come to see me, and I’ll show you something!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought of him as of one who could speak her old language,\\r\\nremembered his odd way of coming abruptly to things that were commonly\\r\\nleft unspoken or only touched upon after a preface of intimacy, as\\r\\nthough they were common enough to be taken for granted, so much a part\\r\\nof one’s habitual thought as to come naturally to any man’s lips. Her\\r\\nharvesting work was done for the year. The little place was neat for\\r\\nwinter, the pantry shelves were filled. She smiled when she looked\\r\\nat those rows of bright jars. She, Anne Denison, “forehanded!” On a\\r\\nday in late September she took her son by the hand and set forth. Not\\r\\nthat Warren permitted himself to be held in leash for long. His legs\\r\\nwere sturdy. How she loved them, their curves and dimples and bruises.\\r\\nHe would trot ahead of her to kick up the leaves, go foraging into\\r\\nthe woods, spring out upon her at the next turn. He howled when he\\r\\ninvestigated a chestnut burr, a moment later joyously presented her\\r\\nwith a spray of asters. Walks with Wanny had their variety. Before they\\r\\ncame in sight of the cottage her ears caught the sound of music. A\\r\\npiano, played rather superbly, she thought. In spite of her restraining\\r\\ncall Warren flew to the door, hammered upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to see what that noise is. Let me in. I want to see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she reached the door it opened, and Kent stood there, laughing. He\\r\\ntook the child’s hand, closed the door behind them, and came down the\\r\\nwalk towards Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve interrupted you,” she said, with an air of apology.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he shook his head. “No. I was playing to my wife. But she’s asleep\\r\\nnow. It always quiets her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry. I did not know Mrs. Kent was ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face bore a worn look, as of one who had not slept. “Always ill. I\\r\\nam very glad you came to see me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been thinking so much, Mr. Kent, of some of the things you said\\r\\nto me that night when I was so wild as to walk in the moonlight.” He\\r\\nlooked at her questioningly, yet she did not find it difficult to speak\\r\\nsimply of what had seemed so simple to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. “Ah--yes.” Then his manner changed. He looked down at\\r\\nWarren. “How would you like to come into my garden? I could show you\\r\\nsomething there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There isn’t any garden any more. We’ve dug the potatoes,” said Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is always a garden,” the man said, laughing. “Come along!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led the way with the boy, talking and answering, for there had to be\\r\\na good deal of answering, with Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a funny garden,” said Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You just wait,” laughed Kent. “And don’t stumble.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path led down sharply. Anne drew a quick breath when it ended\\r\\nabruptly in a cleared space at the base of the hill, a space perhaps\\r\\na full hundred yards across, leveled and smooth, the woods closing\\r\\nit in, sunlight drenching it. Only a few bronzed leaves clung to the\\r\\nlow-growing oaks against its forested wall. For the rest, it was raked\\r\\nclean, like a house swept and garnished. And that, thought Anne, was\\r\\nwhat it must be, a house here in the woods, with the sky for its roof.\\r\\nThere were borders where even now a late rose or two braved the cold\\r\\nnights. At one side a long shallow pool, its banks strengthened with\\r\\nfield stones, caught a bit of the sky’s blue. Just beyond was an arbor,\\r\\nwhite, grape-trellised, and at other places two long low benches of\\r\\ngleaming white. On one of these lay a doll, large as a baby and as\\r\\ndaintily dressed, its legs hanging limply over the side. On the floor\\r\\nof the arbor, in a spot of sunlight, a dog lay. It got up when it saw\\r\\nKent, hobbled joyously towards him on three legs. He stooped and patted\\r\\nit. Warren drew back towards his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never saw a dog like that,” he said. “Where’s all of him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rest of him, you mean?” Kent laughed aloud. “Well, once he was\\r\\ncaught in a trap. The trap bit off his paw. But there are no other dogs\\r\\nhere, you see, so he doesn’t realize how different he is. We don’t\\r\\nremind him of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne remembered, something the doctor had said that first time. “A lot\\r\\nof lame ducks.” This, apparently, was one of them. Then she became\\r\\naware of a face in the depths of the arbor, a form there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jenny,” Kent called. “You Jenny there! Come out here and say ‘how do’\\r\\nto the lady and the young man I’ve brought to call on you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a child; or, surely, the laugh came from a girl who was not\\r\\nquite past childhood. A girl of thirteen or so, Anne thought, when\\r\\nshe haltingly emerged. As she came she seemed to help herself by the\\r\\nside of the arbor where shade lay deepest. Her face wore that curious\\r\\nagedness of the city child who has long been ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A-a-ah! No you don’t,” Kent called out, laughing. “Don’t you touch\\r\\nthat crutch, Jenny!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ain’t, honest I ain’t, Mr. Kent. It’s on the bench!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you’re cheating. You’re holding on to the wall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl giggled delightedly, as at some huge joke. “But I got to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now hear that! I told you to come here. Now then, come along. Come\\r\\nalong.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came to the opening of the arbor, bracing herself by a hand on its\\r\\nside. Anne saw that her body was twisted, restricted by some muscular\\r\\nimpediment, perhaps a form of paralysis. Jenny was smiling, and Kent\\r\\nshook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t do, Jenny. You let go of that door, and come out here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can’t, Mr. Kent. Honest I can’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took a step or two forward, wavered. Anne would have jumped to her\\r\\nside, but Kent’s raised hand warned her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you see that you can. Come along!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA step or two more, and suddenly the girl fell awkwardly, sprawling,\\r\\nlaughing. “Gee, ain’t he funny!” she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nKent helped her up, took her arm and led her to one of the benches.\\r\\n“Now next time, young woman, you’ll walk. Tumbling has gone out of\\r\\nfashion. Do you hear?” he warned her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a heavenly place,” Anne said, “a sort of magic garden, as though\\r\\nthe fairies had lived here a while and then forgotten it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKent nodded. “I made it for my wife. We just about live down here, in\\r\\nthe summer. You see, she’s afraid of the woods, and as they shut in the\\r\\ngarden she’s safe here. She’s afraid to run away, except by the path,\\r\\nand we can watch that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of herself Anne stared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she is like that,” Kent said, quietly. “As I said, it’s the\\r\\nreason for our living here. Where we lived before she was forever\\r\\nrunning away, slipping past all our vigilance. It wasn’t good for her\\r\\nto be constantly watched and she needed the air. Now she is happier.\\r\\nShe has some freedom, but she is safe.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the strange revelation Anne knew nothing to say. Kent went on,\\r\\nas though musing: “That doll over there. It is hers. I shall have to\\r\\ntake it back to the house before she wakes up, or she’ll cry for it.\\r\\nShe calls it her baby, yet at times, you see, she forgets it. When she\\r\\nis very bad. Yes, she is like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Anne said, “The little girl there----”\\r\\n\\r\\nKent smiled. “Oh, Jenny. Yes. We have them here. First one, then\\r\\nanother. Jenny will soon be all right. She went on two crutches a few\\r\\nmonths ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had indeed shown her something in his garden. Anne was certain of\\r\\nthat. His wife “like that,” the lame dog, the child Jenny. She thought\\r\\nof their meeting in the moonlight, and his words, “Not that it matters,\\r\\nthe answer. It’s the search.” Now, in the light of what he had shown\\r\\nher, those words did not ring true. For what was his search, how much\\r\\nwas he seeking? Obviously, the man was not impoverished. He was not\\r\\nheld to Heathville by that dumb and stupid allegiance to the soil that\\r\\nshe read in the simpler people. Yet there he stayed with a mad wife and\\r\\na lame dog and children like Jenny. “We have them here. First one, then\\r\\nanother.” He was not searching, not seeking. He was submitting, letting\\r\\nhimself be held. By what?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had been held by old Willy, as Kent was held by his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the winter the old woman seemed as mentally brisk as ever.\\r\\n“My land,” she said, one cold Sunday morning, “I do wish I could get up\\r\\nthe hill to church. Makes me feel downright wicked, to be so mad about\\r\\nit. Not that I s’ppose it’s any worse to get mad because you can’t go\\r\\nto church than because you can’t dance or something, nor any better,\\r\\neither.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. “I don’t believe it will be held up against you because\\r\\nyou can’t go to church,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy sniffed. “I was talking about getting mad, not about going\\r\\nto church,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed. “Well, I’m sorry you can’t get to church, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So am I. I do want something awful to see that new bonnet the\\r\\nminister’s wife got in the missionary box.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Willy! You wicked old woman! You’ve fooled me for years. I thought you\\r\\nwent to church to say your prayers. I didn’t dream your mind was so set\\r\\non worldly things.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy sniffed. “I do go to church to say my prayers, when I can\\r\\nget there. And if a body’s mind wasn’t mixed up with worldly things,\\r\\nwhat would there be to pray about?” she demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a day in April when the sun shone and from Anne’s window all\\r\\nthe world wore a fresh morning face after rain. Dressing, she looked\\r\\nout upon the familiar scene, now as unconsciously cherished as the\\r\\nfeatures of a beloved. Then she turned to the bed where Warren, now in\\r\\nhis fourth year, lay asleep. He had long since refused to submit to\\r\\na day-time nap, though after his day’s intensive play he was willing\\r\\nenough to go to bed with the chickens. But no birds could wake him\\r\\nearly in the morning. He lay now with his arms and legs outstretched,\\r\\nstrong and plump, his firm flesh tanned by sun and weather. He was her\\r\\nlife, her blessing. Whenever she saw him like that a surge of love all\\r\\nbut choked her. She bent over him before she left the room. He would\\r\\nsleep for hours longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went down quietly, started the kitchen fire as noiselessly as she\\r\\ncould, went out to the hens. The morning air was sweet. Good to breathe\\r\\nit in. She raised her face in the sunshine. When she went in again\\r\\nshe set the simple breakfast to cooking. There was no sound from Miss\\r\\nWilly’s room. Strange, for the old woman had not lost her life-long\\r\\nhabit of waking with the dawn. She would wait patiently until Anne\\r\\ncould find time to help her dress, but always she called out a morning\\r\\ngreeting. Anne softly turned the knob of the bedroom door. The little\\r\\nfigure was lying on its side, one hand under a withered cheek. Anne’s\\r\\nheart leaped. That stillness, and the posture like a child asleep,\\r\\nsecure in a mothering presence near by. She bent over the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Willy was, indeed, asleep. Past waking.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Anne went across the road for the doctor. He made his brief\\r\\nexamination, and stood up, looking at Anne who was unaware of the tears\\r\\non her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” he told her, gently, “yes, she’s gone. Worn out. That’s the best\\r\\nway to go. Finished her work.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sleep at the end of the day,” Anne murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor nodded. “Like David. You remember? ‘Who after he had served\\r\\nhis own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid with\\r\\nhis fathers.’ What’s better than to serve one’s own generation?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She did that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor turned away. “I’ll send women to you,” he said, from the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came, those women. Quietly, reverently they came, not reluctantly\\r\\nto that task from which Anne shrank, but taking it as one of the things\\r\\nto be done, by its very inevitableness removed from horror. She heard\\r\\nthem moving about the room, speaking in low voices behind the closed\\r\\ndoor. They asked her to heat water, and when she had it ready one of\\r\\nthem said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now don’t you feel so bad. Her time had come.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDorilliam’s mother came out to the kitchen. “I didn’t like to open the\\r\\nbureau without you said so. But I know where the things are. She’s had\\r\\n’em laid away a long time. She told me about ’em.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne helped them find the poor, decent clothes, so plain, so clean.\\r\\nSo Willy had thought of her burial, even while she thought so much of\\r\\nliving. Death--Anne remembered the day her father died. Willy had been\\r\\nalone with him. She and Brice had hurried, but arrived too late. She\\r\\nhad been a little in awe of that silent presence, even afraid. She had\\r\\ncried out to Brice when strange men with black bags passed the parlor\\r\\ndoor on the way upstairs, and Brice had closed the door and put his\\r\\narms about her, closed the door against her dread. Now there was no\\r\\nBrice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHurriedly she put that memory from her. There was nothing of fear\\r\\nconnected with Willy’s lying there. Why remember that shielding from\\r\\nthat other fear? She had felt no grief for her father; they had never\\r\\nbeen close together. After he died she had been sorry that they had\\r\\nnever been closer. This was different. Not grief, but something\\r\\ngentler, something more poignant. Or was grief like this? Death like\\r\\nthis quiet passing seemed scarcely mysterious, but only a part of the\\r\\ninevitable round of things. Now she knew something about that round\\r\\nof things. There was winter, a going to sleep, and spring following\\r\\nwinter. She thought of Miss Willy’s springtime, of the little toiling\\r\\ncreature who had wanted her freedom. Had she found freedom now? Or\\r\\nwhat? For there was spring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better let me take Wanny home with me,” said Mrs. Beaman. “The\\r\\ntwins’ll just love looking after him. It ain’t good for children to be\\r\\nin the house when there’s death.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne kissed her. “If you’ll take him for a few hours, later,” she said.\\r\\n“For a day or two I can tell him Miss Willy’s asleep in there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the child played about as usual, whispering when he came into\\r\\nthe kitchen, tiptoeing past the closed door. Willy was asleep. He\\r\\nunderstood that, and Anne dwelt on the thought of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bassett came over the first day, a slender, thin-lipped woman,\\r\\nwith some sprays of geranium in her hand. “Seems like I never get much\\r\\ntime to grow flowers,” she said, “but there’s these.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother brought heliotrope, another a basket of crocuses. One came with\\r\\nnasturtiums. “Seems real nice to see ’em this time o’ year, don’t it?”\\r\\nshe asked, with pride. “They do real well in my south windows. They\\r\\ncome from some seeds she gave me once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night another came, a great white bloom in her hand and on her face\\r\\nthe look of a votary. “My night-bloomin’ cereus. ’Twon’t last, but she\\r\\nalways come over to see it, the night ’twas due to come out. I want she\\r\\nshould have it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day when Anne sent Warren to play with the Beaman children the\\r\\nneighbors gathered solemnly in the parlor, presently to follow Miss\\r\\nWilly, who never had led before. Anne stood by the grave lined with\\r\\nevergreen boughs. There was greenery, too, over the mound of fresh\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who did that?” she asked, as they came away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, we all did. We always do that, for a neighbor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThose women, unimaginative, she had thought them, their lives but one\\r\\nlong labor, too barren for sentiment; yet when the time for sentiment\\r\\ncame they had done that tender service.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day after the funeral Warren went into the bedroom, stood\\r\\nlooking at the bed. “Where’s auntie?” he asked. “When did she wake up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s gone away, Wanny. Where she won’t have to go to sleep any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child stared at her. “Where’s that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ever so far away. Where the spring lives before it comes. Where the\\r\\nbaby birds come from, and baby boys and girls, before they are born.”\\r\\nShe had no sooner spoken the words than she was conscious of the\\r\\nfatuity of them. Why should she cheat the child with sentimentality?\\r\\nWhy not try to tell him the truth? Why deck it out in inanities? But\\r\\nWarren’s eyes were alight and wide-opened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where the fairies live?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps,” she said. “I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well,” said Wanny, “she won’t like it much there. Not without me.\\r\\nI guess she’ll come back soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a day or two afterwards he came to his mother with quivering lip.\\r\\n“I want auntie. Why don’t she come back? Will you tell her to hurry?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne turned her face away. “I want her, too, my lamb. But she can’t\\r\\ncome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why can’t she come? Has she lost her crutch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. She’s lost it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you take it to her, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t, Wanny. I can’t go where she is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, where is she? That’s what I want to know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much theology did one give a child? There had to be something.\\r\\nWhat could one say? She took him in her arms. “Auntie is with her\\r\\nHeavenly Father, my dear. He loves her, and needs her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know he does?”\\r\\n\\r\\nTheology had its difficulties. “I do know. He’s my Heavenly Father,\\r\\ntoo. So I know. Just the way you know mother loves you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWanny thought about that. “Have I got one, too?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe kissed his curls. “Of course. We all have. Now run along and play.\\r\\nMaybe you’d like to help feed the chickens?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a few nights thereafter, while she was making him ready for bed,\\r\\ntaking off his stockings and reveling in the fragrance of his hair\\r\\nagainst her face, he propounded another question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mums,” he asked, “when am I going to my father?”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder old Willy’s handkerchiefs in the top drawer of a bureau they\\r\\nfound a folded sheet of paper. “I am in my right mind and senses. I\\r\\ngive my body to the grave and my soul to the Lord. Everything else is\\r\\nto go to my friend, Anne Warren Denison.” There was Willy’s cramped\\r\\nsignature, and the signature of witnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was no more than right,” said Mrs. Wells, who was one of the\\r\\nwitnesses, “seeing you come here to take care of her in her old age.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing. The date stood out like a pointing finger. Willy\\r\\nhad written it more than five years before she had come to Heathville,\\r\\nat a time when she thought of the old woman once a year, when the\\r\\npurchase of some gift for Christmas was one of those burdensome\\r\\ntrivialities that she got through with as hurriedly as she could. The\\r\\nhouse was hers, the garden, the few hundreds in the savings bank,\\r\\nbecause old Willy had loved her, in her own mind built up about her a\\r\\nlittle tradition that later expressed itself in the kindly falsehood\\r\\nwith which she quieted the curiosity of the neighbors. “Come to take\\r\\ncare of her in her old age.” Perhaps Willy had dreamed of that during\\r\\nthe years she had lived alone. Perhaps she had longed to have someone\\r\\nin her old age. It was a new thing to Anne to have that feeling of\\r\\ndull self-reproach, that consciousness of failure, unmixed with anger.\\r\\nAnger had obliterated any consciousness of failure towards Brice. Now\\r\\nold Willy’s bequest and the inescapable thoughts it brought with it\\r\\nheld a mirror of self-analysis up to her. She could not look around\\r\\nit, nor walk away from it, but must stare and stare at the reflection\\r\\nof herself. And there was another thing that she had to think about.\\r\\nWarren’s questions, his reference to his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilly was dead, Brice had gone out of her life, but the boy remained.\\r\\nNot four years in the world, already he was asking questions she could\\r\\nnot answer. He would grow, would question further. Was she going to\\r\\nfail her son as she had failed those others? Oh yes, Willy had, indeed,\\r\\nhad someone to take care of her in her old age; her longings and her\\r\\npoor little pride had been justified at the end. But Anne could take\\r\\nto herself no credit for that. Willy dead, she could admit her own\\r\\nfailure. If things had fallen out differently, she would have said,\\r\\nwhen word came of the old woman’s death, “The poor old soul!” When word\\r\\ncame of the bequest, she would have said, “How funny! What on earth\\r\\nshall I do with it?” It was only by chance, and because of her own\\r\\nneed, not Willy’s, that she had stood by at the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, now that the time had come when she was free to leave, she had to\\r\\npause for a while, try to read her compass, to take her bearings, for\\r\\nthere were strange seas ahead. She had been drifting. Where was she\\r\\nnow? What was her position, what worth had this place she had thought\\r\\nshe had won to, this security she thought her own toil had achieved for\\r\\nher spirit, this freedom from the bond of obligation? There was Brice.\\r\\nShe had never believed that Brice was dead. Gradually she found herself\\r\\nthinking more and more about Brice, without anger, without bitterness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all life lead on to something, what was waiting for her? What was\\r\\nshe going to meet? Above all, what was Warren going to meet, and\\r\\nhow was she going to help him meet it? Could she escape that slow,\\r\\nonsweeping purpose pervading everything, that warp that ran through\\r\\nthe whole fabric of life? To some natures life is a decomposing thing,\\r\\nto some a stimulus, to others a slow melting-pot, terrible in its\\r\\npersistency, yet all the while in its crucible melting away the baser\\r\\nelements that the purer may emerge. In some natures a gold of the\\r\\nspirit is the residuum, made a thing of itself only after the fires of\\r\\nlife have had their way with it, worked it and fused and refined it.\\r\\nAnne’s physical freedom had come at last only to thrust her into the\\r\\ncore of the crucible, but even yet she was not undergoing its intensest\\r\\nheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too early to begin work in the garden. The fields were drying\\r\\nslowly that year, the season pausing, farmers waiting with impatient\\r\\nacceptance of the inevitable. Many hours during the winter she had\\r\\npassed with Kent before his fireside or in Miss Willy’s parlor or\\r\\ntramping over the rutted roads. He had played to her and loaned her\\r\\nbooks. On a day when the sun was as warm as in June she and Warren\\r\\nstarted for Kent’s house, the boy running here and there to peep into\\r\\nthe buckets hanging to roadside maple trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sap’s running good,” Deacon Bassett told her as they passed his place.\\r\\n“Cold nights and hot suns--that’s what brings the sap up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never encountered Mrs. Kent. Her presence pervaded the house,\\r\\nKent spoke of her frequently, but Anne had dreaded to see her, hoped\\r\\nthat she never would--that woman who played with a doll, who was afraid\\r\\nof the woods and had to be watched lest she run away. In her mind she\\r\\nhad visualized something repulsive. Insanity, she supposed, was a\\r\\nthing of wild impulses, a thing of terror. Pitiful, yes, but dreadful,\\r\\nbetter kept behind bars or in one of those places where “they” had good\\r\\ncare. But on that day she was sitting in a deep chair before a fire\\r\\nof embers, and Kent was playing. The children, Warren and Jenny, were\\r\\nin a window-seat busy about their own affairs. The door opened. Anne\\r\\ncould see, without moving, the slim form that stood there, hesitant.\\r\\nThere was nothing startling, nothing repulsive, about that woman.\\r\\nForty, perhaps, she was obviously fragile, and could never have been\\r\\nbeautiful; but there remained about her a delicacy, a grace, a gentle\\r\\ndesire to please that must once have meant charm. She was smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nKent looked over his shoulder, his fingers still touching the keys.\\r\\n“Come in, Paula,” he said, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Kent came in, step by step, still looking at Anne, until she was\\r\\nstanding in front of her, hands loosely clasped. She waited until the\\r\\nmusic had stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretty lady,” she said, under her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nKent came towards them. “It’s Mrs. Denison, Paula. Aren’t you glad to\\r\\nsee her?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand, and Anne, standing, took it. Paula still looked\\r\\nat her searchingly. “I don’t know her. But she’s pretty. I’m glad she\\r\\ncame to see us. Are we going to have tea, Rufus? Are there any cakes?”\\r\\n\\r\\nKent went out of the room, and his wife took Anne’s hand, led her to a\\r\\nsofa, sat down by her. She was still smiling, still friendly, like a\\r\\nchild in her gentleness. Anne could find nothing to say. Before Kent\\r\\nreturned Wanny slipped from the window-seat, came and stood in front\\r\\nof the pair, his small legs apart, hands clasped behind his back, a\\r\\nposture copied from his firm friend Dorilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaula’s lips parted. She withdrew her hand from Anne’s. “Oh! It’s a\\r\\nchild!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My son Warren,” said Anne. Her maternal instinct at work, she added,\\r\\n“Wanny, say ‘How do you do, Mrs. Kent.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mrs. Kent had slipped to her knees before the boy. She was touching\\r\\nhim, first his bright hair, then his cheek, then his hand. To his\\r\\nmother’s amazement the youngster submitted. Then, quite suddenly, he\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I like you,” said he. “You’re so funny.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPaula sat back on the floor, laughed too. “And I like you, boy.” She\\r\\nlooked up at Anne, leaned closer, whispered. “I have a baby, too. She\\r\\ndoesn’t grow. It worries me. And she never talks. She’s asleep now,\\r\\nor I couldn’t have come down. I’ll show her to you, some day. But her\\r\\nhair--I like the color of your boy’s hair--like fire-light. What is\\r\\nyour name, boy?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWanny told her. Again she fingered the ruddy softness of his hair, and\\r\\nhe laughed aloud. She said, “I like it. I think I will change the color\\r\\nof my baby’s hair to that. Rufus will do it for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will do what, Paula?” Kent asked. He came into the room, the Japanese\\r\\nboy following with a tea-tray whose richness reminded Anne of old days.\\r\\nWhen she had told him, he said, quite naturally, as though it were the\\r\\nmost usual thing in the world to change hair:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course, I will. I will send to the city today for some hair\\r\\nthe color of Wanny’s. In four days from now your baby shall have red\\r\\nhair like his, Paula.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Paula, jumping up, clapped her hands. But then she spied the cakes\\r\\non the tea-tray, grabbed two of them, ate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rufus,” Anne asked, a week or so later when they were walking along\\r\\nthrough the muddy road, “Rufus, why do you keep her there? Why do you\\r\\nhave her live with you?” For one could ask any question, directly, of\\r\\nKent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe frowned, looked puzzled. “I don’t know that I can make it plain\\r\\nto you, Anne, or to myself. But there’s this: one does not discard\\r\\nresponsibility, or care, or what not, by putting it out of sight. One\\r\\nsees a thing through, anyway. Life jolly well sees to it that we do\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, thinking it over, Anne wondered. Was that true? Did one\\r\\nnever escape? Was escape cut off? A thing out of sight--did that follow\\r\\none, haunt, overtake? Or was it always inevitably present? There was\\r\\nher marriage. Brice. She had believed they had escaped each other,\\r\\nand misunderstandings, and the enormous, minute daily rubs. Yet here\\r\\nwas she, here was Warren, with his developing intelligence and his\\r\\nquestions and demands and rights, and there, somewhere, was Brice. Did\\r\\nhe, too, have his demands, his rights? Were they still her concern,\\r\\nagain to become her problem? Was the whole thing still there, for them\\r\\nboth? Was there still that bond, still, still to be reckoned with\\r\\nwhether she would or not? “One sees it through, anyway. Life sees to\\r\\nit that we do that.” Life--what was it? The wheel of the squirrel-cage\\r\\nold Willy had once spoken about, the wheel that one spins and spins,\\r\\nbelieving one’s self the force that drives the world; the cage that one\\r\\ncannot leave, but must return to and return to, because all outside the\\r\\ncage is wilderness?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor days she weighed that question; then came the great crisis of her\\r\\nlife, out of the blue, suddenly, without warning, as crises come. It\\r\\ncame, that flame of Fate which was to burn away slowly, with agony, the\\r\\ndross of her spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fields had dried at last, the plowing of her garden was done. She\\r\\nhad learned by now how to manage her work in the house so that she\\r\\nhad more hours for work in the sun; she held to her habit of rising\\r\\nearly, of getting out into the morning’s freshness. That day she had\\r\\nbeen toiling with spade and rake at leveling the plowed furrows. Wanny\\r\\nwas sleeping late. After a while the height of the sun warned her that\\r\\nhe would soon be clamoring for breakfast. From the kitchen she heard\\r\\nhis voice, not calling, but murmuring as though he were dreaming. She\\r\\ncalled gayly up the stairs:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get up, old Lazybones. See how quickly you can dress yourself! You’re\\r\\ngoing to help mother in the garden today, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not come. Again she went to the foot of the stairs. “Wanny, old\\r\\nBunty’s chicks are out. Hurry up, hurry up!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a wail, low, frightened. She ran up with the quick inward\\r\\npanic that every mother knows how to cover with a smile. The child was\\r\\nlying still, whimpering--Wanny, who never cried. She stood beside the\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But get up, Wanny. Quick--quick! Get up!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t, Mums. Somebody’s taken my legs away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tossed off the covers. For all her pleading, all the child’s\\r\\nefforts, he could not move....\\r\\n\\r\\nWeeks, months--how could she count the time that followed? “A sporadic\\r\\ncase,” Dr. Severance said, shaking his head. “We never know where it\\r\\nwill strike, nor when, nor why. In time, perhaps. But we can’t tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe telephoned Alice, and in two days Alice’s car was there, and a\\r\\nnurse. They carried the child to the city, to a hospital that was\\r\\nsaid to do wonders for infantile paralysis cases. Wanny, like that, a\\r\\n“case”.... There was Nicky, there were Alice and George, there was even\\r\\nAmbrose, but they were like shadows, for all their reality to her. She\\r\\nmust have talked, eaten, slept, but the hours away from the hospital\\r\\nwere blanks, those spent by the child’s bedside sheer agony. Doctors\\r\\ncame. She thanked God for Alice’s money, and in a moment forgot the\\r\\nthought of God and Alice and money. Nurses passed in and out of the\\r\\nroom, were kind, and cheerful, and very busy. She looked at them, spoke\\r\\nto them, and forgot there were nurses. Mornings came at last, when she\\r\\nmight hasten to the hospital. Evenings were only times when Alice or\\r\\nNicky arrived and told her that she would have to go with them. When\\r\\nGeorge suggested calling a specialist from a western city, she eagerly\\r\\nwelcomed the suggestion. Pride? She had none. She would have crawled\\r\\nin the street, abased herself forever, if by doing that she could have\\r\\ngiven a quiver of life to those still limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet after a while they said he was better. They called it that. There\\r\\nwas no “better” to Anne. The child had run and danced and fluttered in\\r\\nand out of the sunshine like a butterfly, as free, as unconscious of\\r\\nhimself. What could “better” mean, when he was still crippled? Better,\\r\\nbecause he could move one leg again? The other was useless. She knew;\\r\\nin time even its rounded beauty would shrivel. They called that being\\r\\nbetter. They said they could do no more for him than that. They said it\\r\\ncheerfully, as though they were making a great gift.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alice,” she said, “I have got to go home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the long way in Alice’s car she thought of that. Home. She\\r\\nthought of it like that. Not a place, this time, to hide herself in.\\r\\nNot a place to wait in, ashamed and sore and bitter. Home. Ah, life\\r\\nwas treacherous! It sneaked upon you, jumped at you from around the\\r\\ncorners. The squirrel-cage, round and round. Safest, within the bars.\\r\\nThat was it. One was safest within the bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found her garden planted and cared for, the rows already green\\r\\nwith vegetables in leaf. Peonies flaunted in the border. The house had\\r\\nbeen cleaned. Windows were open to the summer air. A fire was laid in\\r\\nthe kitchen stove ready for lighting. On the table a loaf of bread was\\r\\nwrapped in a mended napkin. Before supper was ready the Beaman twins\\r\\ncame with a tiny kitten for Wanny. Later, Dr. Severance looked in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’ve done well for him,” he said, when he had examined the boy.\\r\\n“Better than I could. I’ll keep an eye on you both.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Mrs. Wells came. Dorilliam had brought milk that\\r\\nmorning, saying, “Ma says you needn’t bother about paying anything for\\r\\nthe milk for a while. The cow’s fresh, and we just give it to the pigs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother looked at Warren, sitting outside, so still in the sun, the\\r\\nkitten in his lap. “I know how you must be feelin’,” said she. “But\\r\\nthere’s one thing. You got him. It’d be worse, if he had been took.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing. It was true that she had him. More than ever she had\\r\\nhim now, held in her heart with a passion of protectiveness, a passion\\r\\nsurpassing anything she had known while he was active and well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know how ’tis,” said Dorilliam’s mother, “because I lost one. The\\r\\nfifth, it was, and we were real poor that winter, and folks said ’twas\\r\\njust as well he was taken. We knew they said it. We got seven in all,\\r\\nnow, good boys, every one of them. But there’s always the one we lost.\\r\\nWe don’t talk much about it. Don’t have to. Pa, he ain’t the talkin’\\r\\nkind. Maybe I’m not, either. But I guess we both know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was looking at her: had she ever seen her before, that squat,\\r\\nhomely woman, the drudge, the--unthinking?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Every spring pa goes up to the buryin’ ground with a rake and clears\\r\\noff. There’s a bush there, sweet brier, I planted. No, we don’t say\\r\\nmuch. But there’s always the one we lost. The others are good boys,\\r\\nevery one of them. I know that other was spared a lot. But--well, we\\r\\nlost him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother came, a slim, spare spinster who lived and worked hard in her\\r\\nbrother’s house. Anne knew her by the name all the neighborhood called\\r\\nher, Miss Abby. She had spoken to her often before, been a little\\r\\namused at the way the type exemplified itself in her, prim, dried, with\\r\\neyes that saw everything and lips that pursed themselves as though to\\r\\nkeep back those comments that were best unspoken, at any rate when one\\r\\nlived in one’s brother’s house and was thankful enough for a home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I just thought I’d run over,” said she. “Wondered if maybe there\\r\\nwasn’t some sewing I could do for you, evenin’s. I got plenty of time\\r\\non my hands, evenin’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was going, she hesitated in the doorway, looked up at Anne. “You\\r\\ngot a real nice home here,” she said. “A child of your own’s a good bit\\r\\nof comp’ny.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Ware came, both arms full of shining glass jars. “My canned\\r\\npeaches,” she told Anne with pride, “and some jell. I want you should\\r\\ntaste them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne thanked her and smiled. “A generous taste, Mrs. Ware,” said she.\\r\\n“They look wonderful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s more where those come from. You won’t get much time for\\r\\ncanning this year.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had thought her a silent woman, hard, intent on her business of\\r\\nfeeding a family. Mr. Ware had a large farm, kept four “hands” in\\r\\nsummer. But this day whatever impediment usually sealed Mrs. Ware’s\\r\\nlips was removed for the moment. She gave Anne a shy look.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our eldest girl, now. She had what Wanny’s got. I guess ’twas that.\\r\\nAn’ it went to her head. They said if she lived she’d never be--right.\\r\\nOh, I’m so thankful your boy’s--all right!”\\r\\n\\r\\nImpulsively, Anne kissed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd still others came. Some made no comment on Warren, some offered a\\r\\nbit of old-fashioned advice, brought a remedy, or a tonic for Anne,\\r\\nor some other small gift. Most came quite simply to visit. Anne\\r\\nunderstood, after a time. They were accepting her as one of themselves,\\r\\na woman living through the lot that is woman’s. They were standing by,\\r\\nspiritually shoulder to shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequently Kent came, always with something for the child. One day\\r\\nhe arrived with a large bulging parcel under his arm, Jenny giggling\\r\\nbehind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what to do with this girl,” said he. “She says she won’t\\r\\nlive with us any longer. Wants to come here to live with you and Wanny!”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny laughed and nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s an independent young person, is Jenny. You see, she can board\\r\\nwhere she likes. She has friends, who pay the large sum of four dollars\\r\\na week so that Jenny may eat. And she does eat. My word, how Jenny does\\r\\neat! Now’s she tired of our food, and wants to try yours. What do you\\r\\nsay, Mrs. Denison?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne flushed. She saw through the simple ruse. “Ah, Rufus----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But say, lookit, honest, Mis’ Denison, there’s a heap I can do. I’m\\r\\nfourteen now, goin’ on fifteen. And he’s jokin’ about all I eat.\\r\\nThere’s a heap I can do and I’d just love to look after Wanny.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny stayed. Said Rufus, “No use getting morbid, my friend. And you\\r\\nwill be that, if you keep yourself shut up here alone with the child.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne held out her hand. “You’re a good friend,” she said, and instantly\\r\\nthere came into her mind another time when she had used those same\\r\\nwords to another man. To Ranney Copeland. “A good friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there were days when Anne could get out, days when she walked with\\r\\nKent over the roads and hills, or went to his garden for tea, or\\r\\nlistened to his music.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People will talk,” she told him one day when he was proposing a long\\r\\ntramp. But Kent shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think not,” he said. “It’s an odd thing, that, in these country\\r\\npeople. They do gossip. No doubt of that. But there’s a deep\\r\\nunderstanding about them, too. And a loyalty. No, I don’t think they\\r\\nwill talk.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA bit farther on he looked down at her. “Anne, would you mind, if they\\r\\ndid? If they ‘talked’?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered. “I think I should. Not in the same way I once might\\r\\nhave minded. Indeed, there was a time when I dared that, and more,\\r\\nwithout caring. But now I should care. Because I want them to like me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKent smiled, as though his question were answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s heart was continuously wrung when she watched Warren moving\\r\\nabout, learning to use his crutch, contriving queer little ways to\\r\\nachieve what he used to at a bound; but with a child’s ready acceptance\\r\\nof circumstances he seemed before long to be unaware of the impediment.\\r\\nThe girl Jenny helped him. She herself had been crippled for years. To\\r\\nher there was nothing strange about being impeded as Wanny was. You\\r\\njust got along. Jenny, too, was proving herself increasingly useful,\\r\\nand as always, when her hands had but little to do, Anne’s mind was\\r\\nactive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce or twice during old Willy’s life Anne had gone with her to the\\r\\nwhite-spired church down the road. Once or twice had been enough.\\r\\nBut now she began to think of it again. It was never open except on\\r\\nSunday. It was bare, colorless, uncomfortable. The form of service\\r\\nwas unlike anything she had ever seen before, unfamiliar hymns droned\\r\\nout to the accompaniment of an ornate walnut melodeon set casually\\r\\nacross a corner, readings in which minister and people took part,\\r\\nthough Anne could never find them in the book until they were half\\r\\nover; long prayers that seemed to her to be filled with banalities and\\r\\nunwarrantable personalities; a wooden box on the end of a short pole\\r\\nthrust along the pews, and a sermon to follow. Nothing there for her.\\r\\nYet the neighbors went continually. Or it may have been faithfully, as\\r\\nthough it meant something to them. Perhaps they did get something from\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Sunday she left Warren with Jenny, dressed herself in her\\r\\nsix-year-old best, and walked up the road as the bell was ringing. It\\r\\nwas just as she had remembered it. Not a head turned when Anne went\\r\\ninto the church, although she knew that everyone there was aware of\\r\\nher. No one came forward to show her where to sit. She understood. They\\r\\nthought of her as quite naturally taking her place as one of them. The\\r\\nday was cool. A fire had been lighted in the corrugated cast-iron stove\\r\\nat the back. The place had become over-heated, and through the open\\r\\nwindows flies swarmed in, swirling and buzzing in the heavy air. Again\\r\\nthose hymns in unison, except when some adventurous soul attempted\\r\\nan alto or tenor that did nothing to enhance the harmony. Again the\\r\\nlong prayers with men sitting stolid and women with hands to their\\r\\nforeheads. Again the sermon. Anne knew the minister. She had seen\\r\\nhim many a morning leading his cow to pasture or working his garden,\\r\\nand sometimes in the afternoons passing her house on his way to some\\r\\nparochial visit, dressed in ministerial garb of long black-skirted\\r\\ncoat that flapped oddly about his bent legs. Someone had told her that\\r\\nhe had been a blacksmith in his youth. He preached earnestly, with\\r\\nstrange, frequently repeated gestures, awkward, his voice thundering\\r\\nphrases he had caught from the newspapers. “And he smote them hip and\\r\\nthigh with a great slaughter, and he went down and dwelt in the top of\\r\\nthe rock Etam,” his text was. He shrieked out the words over and over;\\r\\n“they” should be smitten hip and thigh, their slaughter punished with\\r\\ngreater slaughter. He was vague enough about the rock Etam, vague as to\\r\\nwho should be smitten or why, yet he repeated the phrase over and over.\\r\\nHis earnestness was grotesque, pitiable. He jumped up and down like a\\r\\nmasquerading child in a futile rage. But Mrs. Wells sat placid, there\\r\\nwas a smile on Deacon Bassett’s face, as he occasionally nodded his\\r\\nhead; men and women who got up before dawn to make their days longer\\r\\nsat there and listened, or sat there decorously at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the service was over. Anne was for slipping away unobserved,\\r\\nbut found her way blocked by the welcoming hand of Deacon Bassett. Mrs.\\r\\nWells stopped her in the aisle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the road she was joined by the small, spare spinster who had been\\r\\nto see her more than once since her return from the city with Wanny.\\r\\nMiss Abby’s manner of speaking oddly matched her manner of walking. Her\\r\\nsteps were short, quick, determined.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see you come to it, too,” said she. “Like me. Time was when I didn’t\\r\\ngo to meetin’, either.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt that she must say something. “The sermon was--” she faltered,\\r\\nunable to find appropriate words, groping for something she could say,\\r\\nsomething one of the flock would be glad to hear about that sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know all about the sermon,” Miss Abby supplied, dryly. “You\\r\\ndon’t need to say anything about the sermon. If folks went to church\\r\\nto hear the sermon, they’d stay to home. That’s what I used to do. But\\r\\nnow I go. Regular.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Anne said nothing. She had long since discovered that silence was\\r\\nnot only permissible among these direct country folk, but often the\\r\\nsurest means of getting them to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guess maybe it’s the same way with you as ’twas with me,” said Miss\\r\\nAbby. “I go because it’s like keepin’ step.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keeping step?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Ever try walkin’ along with a body and takin’ your own way while\\r\\nshe keeps hers? Tires you out. Keepin’ step’s dif’rent. You can go\\r\\nquite a ways without gettin’ all ragged out, if you keep in step.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Abby nodded. “Yes. It’s what lots of folks go to church for,\\r\\nI guess. I’ve heard ’em say they go there to pray. But ’tain’t so.\\r\\nNot with a lot of ’em, anyway. Not with me. I could say my prayers\\r\\nanywhere, just as well as in church. Better, some places. But I used to\\r\\nrebel. Against quite a good deal. Now I don’t. Not so much, anyway. Now\\r\\nI keep step. It’s easier to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese people in Heathville had their tragedies, large and small. They\\r\\nworked, they bore children and suffered. They were poor. For so long\\r\\nshe had believed them submissive, or dulled to acceptance of an empty\\r\\ndaily routine. Now she was beginning to see that they must have had\\r\\ntheir inner struggles, their questionings. Miss Abby “used to rebel,”\\r\\nold Willy had wanted her freedom. All humanity falters and stumbles,\\r\\ncatches itself, goes on; drops in the ranks, recovers, gets up again\\r\\nand struggles on, keeps step, or tries to. Was the power of going on,\\r\\nof enduring, of finding a basis of living, of avoiding the bruised\\r\\nknees and stubbed toes, only to be found through keeping step? That\\r\\nlittle Miss Abby had no place in the world, merely filled a niche in\\r\\nher brother’s household that could have been filled as well by any\\r\\nother member of the family, or need not have been filled at all. She\\r\\nwas negligible. Yet even she had had her puny rebellions. As Willy had\\r\\nwanted to be free, so had Miss Abby wanted to set her own pace. Perhaps\\r\\nshe had even had hopes and ambitions, all coming at last to trying to\\r\\nkeep in step, to keep along. Because it was easier. Easier, or the only\\r\\nworking basis to be found. No use rebelling, trying, struggling. Anne’s\\r\\nthoughts brought her back again to the question of ambition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To succeed in one’s soul, ambition must become longing.” What had she\\r\\never longed for? Warren’s activity back again, yes. But concerning\\r\\nherself, the intimate self that was.... What was that intimate self?\\r\\nShe had never thought much about her soul. Things, money, position,\\r\\ngayety, power--those she had wanted, wanted terribly. There was a point\\r\\nto wanting, a reason for it, in that sense. The aim of it was definite.\\r\\nBut what was longing? As senseless as Miss Abby’s keeping step: it got\\r\\nyou nowhere. Yet there was something, there was something. People lived\\r\\non, found a means of living on, found something that lifted life above\\r\\nexistence. What was it, where was it? She had not failed, not weakened\\r\\nnor faltered in the struggle, yet she was stranded, groping for she\\r\\nknew not what, her soul crying out for help. And there was no answer.\\r\\nDisaster had come to her, motherhood, poverty, work, the last blow\\r\\nstruck through the heart of her heart: she was still herself, still\\r\\nAnne Denison. Personality remained, persisting, surviving through it\\r\\nall. Looking back on her life with Brice, she could not see where she\\r\\nhad failed. She had been well-intentioned. There had even been love\\r\\nbetween herself and Brice. At this distance, after these years, she\\r\\nwondered what had become of that love. It was like her anger, burned\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange, what had brought on the disaster between him and herself. That\\r\\nfusillade of anger on their last night--she could see it as terrible,\\r\\nnow, in its suddenness, in the way it had burst out with all the\\r\\ndevastating force of the unforeseen. She had read of bomb outrages,\\r\\nwhere some moronic miscreant lays a hideous thing with a fuse in the\\r\\nway of innocent people. Then, explosion and death, or life maimed\\r\\nforever. Something like that was the moment of uncontrolled fury on\\r\\nher part and Brice’s, that moment that maimed life and killed love for\\r\\nthem. There must have been a fuse, must have been some small, furtive\\r\\nthing, futile perhaps in itself, yet vicious enough at last to have\\r\\ncaused that explosion. What was it that had burned its way into her\\r\\nnerves and brain, into Brice’s? Right things did not explode. Right\\r\\nthings were orderly, like life and growth, spring and summer. How far\\r\\nfrom right, how far from clean orderliness must she and Brice have\\r\\ngotten for disaster so complete to have overtaken them? She had blamed\\r\\nBrice, blamed life and circumstance, denied blame on her own part. She\\r\\nhad fallen back on her pride, endured pain, submitted to poverty and\\r\\ngiven herself to toil. But now she wanted something more. Not help, not\\r\\nrescue. She wanted to probe until a meaning might be found, or if not a\\r\\nmeaning, truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not looking as well as you might,” Dr. Severance said. “Too\\r\\nshut up, here. Come drive around with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went with him, many times. They were long drives, into the by-ways\\r\\nof the hills.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you manage to get around to these far-away people?” Anne asked\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t. Not as a doctor should. Of course I do the best I can, but\\r\\nthey have to wait--disastrously, many times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me they have to wait for everything. And so little comes\\r\\nafter all the waiting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, they’re sure of birth and death. That’s about as much as any of us\\r\\nare sure of,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What holds them to it?” Anne asked. “Just that they can’t get away?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said the doctor. “Sometimes habit, lack of initiative. Some are\\r\\nsatisfied. Some are too timid to run out of their burrows.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there no joy? Is there nothing that carries them along with it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ask them,” the doctor said. “They’ll always talk about themselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stopped at a house where a man sat on the steps, heavy,\\r\\nblack-bearded, with small black eyes gleaming steadily beneath his\\r\\nshaggy eyebrows with the sinister watchfulness of a serpent’s. The\\r\\ndoctor went into the house and Anne spoke to the man, using the\\r\\ninvariable introduction of the country, a remark on the weather. He did\\r\\nnot get up, but replied affably enough. Then she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry your wife is sick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She wouldn’t have to be, if she’d take the kind o’ medicine I do.\\r\\nReg’lar heart-pills, they be. But the woman, she wants the doctor all\\r\\nthe time. Still and all,” with a brief sly look upward and a fleeting\\r\\ngrin, “he’s cheaper. He don’t charge northin.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne said nothing else, looked about her. There were blossoming\\r\\npetunias trained against the house on strings, a lanky begonia in a can\\r\\nset on a window-sill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are ‘reg’lar heart-pills’?” she asked, as they drove away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor smiled. “Strychnine, mostly. He used to take grain alcohol.\\r\\nNow it’s hard cider. When that’s gone, he tramps six miles down to the\\r\\nvillage and buys ‘reg’lar heart-pills.’ Spends all his wages that way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the woman?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cancer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made a helpless gesture with her hands. “What have they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God knows,” said the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut another day Anne went into the house. “I brought you up some\\r\\ntomatoes,” she said. “There are more in my garden than I could use.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman smiled. “I ain’t seen any this year. The man don’t like ’em.\\r\\nHe don’t like any vegetables much, excepting potatoes and maybe a mess\\r\\no’ dandelions, so we don’t grow ’em.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, of course not. No use cooking for one,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. That’s what worries me, layin’ here like this. What’ll he do for\\r\\npie, after I’m gone? He’s set on havin’ his pie. He ain’t much of a\\r\\nhand at doing for himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day they stopped at a house where a baby was wailing, its\\r\\nmother, a girl who looked like a child, holding it in her lap like a\\r\\ndoll, swinging the while in a ragged hammock. An older woman came to\\r\\nthe door when the car stopped, but went hurriedly in when she saw Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Elsie,” the doctor called out, cheerily, “how’s the future\\r\\nPresident?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl came forward, smiling. When she saw a stranger in the doctor’s\\r\\ncar she stopped short and the smile faded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You come here and show off that baby,” the doctor said. The girl came\\r\\nshyly, and Anne held out her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, let me hold him a minute,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl gave up the child, and flushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell Elsie,” Dr. Severance said, “that there’s nothing in all this\\r\\nworld as wonderful as being a mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except the baby itself. That’s more wonderful. Isn’t it?” she asked.\\r\\nThe girl nodded, and took the child back, and held it to her breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that was the girl’s mother who dodged when she saw us,” said the\\r\\ndoctor as he started the car again. “She’s ashamed. Nothing like that\\r\\never happened in her family before, you see. Elsie’s not married.” A\\r\\nfew hundred yards from the house they passed a stalwart lad who waved\\r\\nto the doctor. Anne, turning to watch him, saw the girl running along\\r\\nthe road to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Floyd Travers? Yes, he’s a fine lad,” Dr. Severance said. “His father\\r\\nhas a big dairy farm. He’s going to marry Elsie.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That clean-looking boy? Was he----?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. But he says he’s not going to have her live where folks are\\r\\nashamed of her. He’s building a house. They’ll be married when it’s\\r\\ndone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\nKent was looking worn in those days. Paula, Anne knew, kept much to her\\r\\nroom. She wondered what must go on in that house. To herself Kent was\\r\\nalways the welcoming friend. Once or twice when she was there Paula\\r\\ncame in, sat beside her, held her hand, then whispered something about\\r\\nher baby, and drifted out again like a pale wraith of womanhood. One\\r\\nday Anne was sitting before the fire while the early dusk crept in.\\r\\nKent was playing, but presently the music ceased. Kent crossed the room\\r\\nto drop wearily into a chair by the hearth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tired, Rufus?” Anne asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ran a hand wearily up over his forehead. “Oh, out of tune, Anne, out\\r\\nof tune.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, life is all discord. That is the trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat forward, some faint color returning to his face. “Thank you for\\r\\nsaying that, because it gives me back some of my fighting edge. It’s\\r\\nnot discord, Anne. Don’t you believe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tuneless, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, if it’s tunes you want--! But harmony, rhythm. That is what\\r\\ncounts. You get into the rhythm, and you’re fixed. Get into it, drift\\r\\ninto it, fight into it, but get there. That’s God.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was leaning forward with his clasped hands dropped between his\\r\\nknees, looking into the fire. Suddenly Anne felt his eyes on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Anne, I’m going to tell you something. There is a woman I\\r\\nhave loved for years as a thirsty beast loves a spring. As a blind man\\r\\nloves the light. I was parched and blind before I knew her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rufus----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t say that as if you were sorry. You don’t know. Listen. I want to\\r\\ntell you. There’s Paula. Like that for two months before our child was\\r\\nborn. They said her mind would come back. It never did. The child was\\r\\ndead, but it wasn’t that. Heredity, and the illness before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had met Rose before Paula’s illness. Somehow, afterwards--well, you\\r\\ndon’t know how those things come. It was there, between us, shared\\r\\nby us. We both knew. It came to us like a bolt, our knowing. Even\\r\\nwith Paula like that, I was willing to do anything--oh, dear God!\\r\\nwilling--such a word, for what that thirst was. That thirst. Rose\\r\\nwould have dared, faced the world and dared. She wasn’t afraid. It\\r\\nwasn’t fear that held her back. No, not back, above. She saw something\\r\\nbeyond. It seemed to me that to be with her, to possess her and be\\r\\npossessed, would be to have found the summit, to stand on it, the world\\r\\nunderneath. But she wanted more than that. Something finer. She could\\r\\nforego things of the body, to make sure of possessing things of the\\r\\nsoul. She made me see. It wasn’t easy. But she made me see. One is\\r\\ncarried along by something, once one has it. Something above discord.\\r\\nSomething that solves discord. Harmony. Rhythm. I can’t say it any\\r\\nbetter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if one doesn’t consciously have it or feel it? If one doesn’t find\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter. Oh, I’m not saying that it can’t be found, or had. One\\r\\nstumbles, and finds the firm earth. Or to say it more clearly, one\\r\\nstumbles into a current that bears him up, carries him along. I don’t\\r\\nknow what it is. I don’t care what you call it. I do know it’s there.\\r\\nHere. A thing to grasp and to let one’s self drift upon, both. A thing\\r\\nyou’ve got to get hold of if you’re going to get hold of life, not\\r\\nmerely live. Faith’s the core of it. Not merely believing in anything,\\r\\nexactly. It may be that, too. I don’t know. Faith. There’s no other\\r\\nword I can think of. It’s as good as another, if you don’t try to pin\\r\\nit down to belief in a ritual. That’s all right, too, I dare say. If\\r\\none needs it. What I mean is a getting in touch, through what’s in us\\r\\nall. The spirit, maybe you’d call it. Anyway, faith. When you say that,\\r\\nyou’re bound to think, ‘Faith--in--God.’ That’s in our blood, in our\\r\\nbones. It’s not fetishism. May have been once, when our skulls were\\r\\nshaped differently. But I doubt it. Because we are animals. Breath of\\r\\nlife’s in us. Even a dog longs for the active peace of surrender to\\r\\nsomething that’s stronger and greater than he is. Put a dog on a chain,\\r\\nin a kennel, force him to surrender to something he knows is less\\r\\npowerful, less fine than himself, and what do you see? Humiliation.\\r\\nDegradation, conscious degradation. Same with man. We’ve got to stand\\r\\nup, decently, cleanly, and answer to something that’s bigger than we\\r\\nare. Better than we are. Why not God? All right. Then what’s next?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been wondering----!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. One does wonder. Rose made me see that our own little personal\\r\\nwonder and doubt is too insignificant to matter, once one has touched\\r\\nfaith. I could see nothing active in the idea. I wasn’t willing to\\r\\nhymn-sing. Well--it was she who sent those children down here to me.\\r\\nI didn’t want them here. They were a nuisance. She laughed. She does,\\r\\nwhen she’s very serious. ‘You need them, you know,’ she told me. ‘You\\r\\nare looking for something, and you have not found it. You look with\\r\\nyour mind.’ I didn’t know what she meant. ‘Force what you’re reaching\\r\\nfor into that child, and see what will happen,’ she said. ‘But if I\\r\\ndon’t know--?’ I asked her. She laughed again. ‘What is it you want to\\r\\nknow? How to go on? What to go on with? What can be found that will\\r\\ncarry you on? A hand in the dark? There is something. Tell the child\\r\\nso!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If one knew what it is,” Anne murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. I didn’t. One day I was watching the little beggar fumbling\\r\\nabout with his crutch. ‘Look here,’ I said, ‘why don’t you leave that\\r\\nthing alone? Why don’t you forget about it? You can.’ I was as startled\\r\\nas he was, but after I’d said it I couldn’t see why not. So I kept\\r\\ntelling him that he was not really paralyzed, that he could walk. And\\r\\none day he did.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s hand went to her cheek. Her lips parted. Kent nodded. “I know.\\r\\nBut that’s truth. I saw it. The kid walked. Just as others have done.\\r\\nJust as Jenny did. Startling? I was blinded, at first. Fairly stunned.\\r\\nThen I got hold of it. I got the thing with conviction. Something had\\r\\nhappened to that youngster, and he had walked. Some energy had been\\r\\nreleased. Or else he had touched it, taken it into himself. Well, then,\\r\\nif he could, why not others? To walk, having been paralyzed--what,\\r\\nafter all, was that? People went on, lived,--lived, I say!--with worse\\r\\nthings to endure than lame legs. What does it? What keeps the world\\r\\ngoing, anyway? Is it all automatic, something that, started, has to go\\r\\non and on? Hear a bird sing, look at the stars, and you know it’s not\\r\\nthat. All right, then--God. Purpose. Has to be. There’s nothing else.\\r\\nAnd how had that kid come in touch with it? He had believed what I told\\r\\nhim over and over. Something inside of him had accepted the truth of\\r\\nit, even though I did not. His poor little faith touched the spark.\\r\\nThat purpose. That rightness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent a while. Presently Anne said: “You turned on the spark\\r\\nin the doctor’s car, that day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tossed his head back. “The doctor! He speaks of my faith cures.\\r\\nI have nothing to do with it. He uses the same faith over and over\\r\\nevery day. Grins at an old chap and gives him a pill. Puts his hand on\\r\\nsomebody’s pulse and tells him it’s all right. And they’re better. I\\r\\ntell you, there’s some basic energy. God--faith--love--eternal purpose.\\r\\nSomething that we can make use of, take into ourselves. Something that\\r\\ncarries us on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You spoke of rightness.... But, Rufus, there are things like my boy,\\r\\nlike Paula.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brushed the hair from his forehead. “Oh, I know. And many another\\r\\nthing that’s called tragedy. But after all, isn’t tragedy a thing\\r\\nof the soul, Anne? If one finds God, as I mean God--gets in touch,\\r\\nsomehow, with purpose that’s energy, so that one can live along with\\r\\nhis tragedy, it’s never quite that. There’s something besides. Physical\\r\\nthings are so little, so easily hurt, bruised, crushed. What do they\\r\\nmatter!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne got to her feet, flung out her arms. “They do matter! One has\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAbruptly his exalted mood left him. “They do. God--I know that. I\\r\\nfalter. Everyone does. But I’ve found out that the only way to rectify\\r\\nour troubles and weaknesses and failures is to reach out for something\\r\\nthat will harmonize them all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To reach out--! But who has ever found?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not saying one may arrive at the absolute. But I know I’ve\\r\\nglimpsed it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what can harmonize failure, Rufus, and suffering and all our human\\r\\ndisasters?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else could do it but having a sense of being part of the whole, a\\r\\nconsciousness that the whole is part of us? Could earth endure winter,\\r\\nif there were no spring to come? Wouldn’t all mankind want to commit\\r\\nsuicide, if there were not the sure knowledge that others are to come\\r\\nafter us? Could I be an individual, if I were not part of the whole?\\r\\nCan you think of a purposeless whole? No. One cannot conceive of chaos.\\r\\nAny more than of ether, or the radiations of unseen stars. Then if\\r\\nthere is, is a purposeful whole, there’s some purpose sweeping through\\r\\nit and carrying it along. Rhythm, or God. That’s the harmony, and the\\r\\nharmonizing motivation, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If that is so, if it’s there waiting for us anyway, the rhythm, the\\r\\nharmony, what need of faith?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Melody sleeps in the mute strings, doesn’t it? There must be the\\r\\nhand on the bow, to make the strings speak. An engine with steam up\\r\\nmay be pulsing and waiting, but for all purposes it’s only a hideous\\r\\ncontrivance of steel and iron until a hand on the lever releases it to\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat down again. She was looking into distant things, dim things,\\r\\nin which others were forming. “A hand on the lever.... Do you really\\r\\nbelieve that if one does find that faith, or purpose, whatever you mean\\r\\nby God, one really can use it, put it to personal use, put it to work?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Faith, as I mean it, is force, that part of harmony and strength and\\r\\nrightness that can be drawn by man into himself. Faith, as force, can\\r\\nbe acquired, can be developed, can be used. Possessing it in that\\r\\nsense, man steps into his place again as a working part of the whole\\r\\norder of rightness. Of purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rightness. Oh, what, anyway, is good, or goodness? You admitted that\\r\\none never can touch the absolute.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear girl, you’re muddling things. Humanity is never absolute. We are\\r\\nalways moving, always forming. Of course I don’t know what goodness\\r\\nis. If it’s anything at all, it ought to be one thing for you and\\r\\nmaybe another for me. But good--I do know what good is! What could\\r\\nit be, but a conscious activity wherein all our conflicts and all\\r\\nour bewilderments, all our entangling habits and preconceptions and\\r\\nfailures, and what you called our disasters, emerge into some working\\r\\norder?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That could never be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Doesn’t it have to be, if we’re going on, catching the rhythm and\\r\\ncarried with it and by it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By faith, just by faith? Oh, Rufus!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. God--faith--love. Why be afraid of the words?” He stood up,\\r\\nstretched his arms, laughed. “Oh, I know we’re all confoundedly afraid\\r\\nof words. They’ve had all sorts of meanings piled on to them during\\r\\nthe ages, got themselves entangled with the very inconsistencies that\\r\\nmade them necessary. They began as definitions, and they’ve become\\r\\nequivocations. So we’re afraid of them. But there were primitive needs\\r\\nthat gave rise to them, Anne, and there are primitive things, eternal\\r\\nthings, still in them, working out through them. Think it out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a morning later in spring Miss Abby overtook her again on the road\\r\\nand gave her a bunch of arbutus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m always the first one around here to find any,” she said. “Ain’t\\r\\nthey pretty? Seems queer, how they get to smell like that, growin’ out\\r\\nof the mold the way they do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before the arbutus faded the neighborhood was shaken by a tragedy.\\r\\nDorilliam came hammering on the door one morning before Warren and\\r\\nJenny were awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Deacon Bassett’s hung hisself in the barn,” he cried, and ran to\\r\\nspread his news farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found a cloak, remembered to close the draft of the stove, ran\\r\\nup the muddy road. About the barn a group of men clustered, standing\\r\\nawkwardly, apparently waiting for something further to happen. Inside\\r\\nthe house Mrs. Bassett was sitting very straight in a rocking-chair,\\r\\ntight-lipped and silent. Other women were in the room, busying\\r\\nthemselves about the things Mrs. Bassett must ordinarily have done.\\r\\nThey gave Anne significant looks, and one by one went away. Mrs.\\r\\nBassett might have been an image of stone, except for the rise and fall\\r\\nof her breast; but suddenly she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I kept waiting and waiting,” she said. “For things to get better. And\\r\\nnow it’s come to this. He ain’t ever spoke to me, not for more’n twenty\\r\\nyears, any more’n he could help. I ain’t ever had a dollar o’ my own\\r\\nto spend. The children, they left home as soon as they could. I never\\r\\nblamed ’em. Now one of ’em’s dead. The other one’s out in California.\\r\\nHe hasn’t wrote for over a year. I kept waiting and waiting. And now\\r\\nit’s come to this. And the house is mortgaged.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor twenty years ... and it had come to that. Anne went away sick at\\r\\nheart. She met Kent, coming along the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rufus,” she asked, waving a hand towards the place where the men still\\r\\nlingered, “what do you make of things like that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was pale. He shook his head slowly. “I know, Anne, I know. There’s\\r\\nnot much to say. Except--‘Lord, I believe. Help thou mine unbelief.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on to her own house. The children were awake, their voices\\r\\ncoming down to the kitchen. Outside a bluebird called. On the back of\\r\\nthe stove the kettle was humming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening she could neither sew nor read. When her work was done she\\r\\nsat with her hands in her lap. The children were busy at the table with\\r\\nscissors and paste and bits of colored paper, but the meaning of their\\r\\nchatter scarcely penetrated to her consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, now you listen to me, Wanny Denison,” Jenny warned for the third\\r\\ntime. “If you drop the scissors again you’ll get down and pick ’em up\\r\\nyourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t,” Wanny replied, serenely. “My crutch won’t bend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t have to use your old crutch, anyway,” said Jenny. “I don’t\\r\\nuse mine any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s silly,” said Warren. “Cause I do have to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you don’t, either. It’s fun, trying to go without it. And you can,\\r\\nif you try.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re a girl,” Warren said, nonchalantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny sat back and stared at him. “Well, of course I’m a girl. What’s\\r\\nthat got to do with it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Girls can’t tell the truth if they try to. That’s what D’rilliam says.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny blazed. “D’rilliam’s a liar!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ho! Mums, Mums, look at me, look at me! Did you hear Jenny swear,\\r\\nMums? She swore.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t, either, Mis’ Denison! Honest, I didn’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” Anne agreed, “I don’t think you swore, Jenny. What were you\\r\\ntrying to tell Warren?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He don’t have to use his crutch, Mis’ Denison. Honest, he don’t. He\\r\\njust won’t believe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why won’t you, Wanny?” Warren stared at her. “You believe so many\\r\\nthings. Why not that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do have to use it. That’s why. I’d fall down without it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Anne was startled out of her thoughts of breakfast by\\r\\nhowls from upstairs. She ran up, to discover the boy sitting on the\\r\\nside of the bed and pommeling Jenny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You go ’way. You go ’way,” he was yelling. “You let me alone. You go\\r\\n’way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gee, Mis’ Denison. I dunno what’s got into him,” the bewildered Jenny\\r\\nexclaimed. “I got him half dressed, and the minute my back was turned\\r\\nhe set up a-howling and yelling. He fell on the floor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Warren! Stop that, stop fighting, stop crying! What is the matter with\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hate you,” cried Wanny. “Jenny’s a liar and you are a liar. I hate\\r\\nyou!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s swearing now?” put in Jenny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She said I didn’t have to use any crutch. You said to believe it. And\\r\\nI fell down. I hate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, go on hating me,” said Anne. “Go on crying. And fall down\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“D--don’t you care?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course I care. So does Jenny. But we both think you’re a very\\r\\nsilly boy. Once Jenny couldn’t walk without a crutch----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two of ’em!” from Jenny.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two of them. Mr. Kent told her to make-believe she could walk without\\r\\nany. After a time she could. So of course Jenny thinks you are silly\\r\\nnot to make-believe, too. And of course I think you’re silly. If I had\\r\\nto use a crutch, I’d think about it hard, hard, hard, until I didn’t\\r\\nhave to use it any more. Until I could walk and run and climb trees and\\r\\nmaybe drive a hay-wagon the way Dorilliam does. But of course it’s your\\r\\nown affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe you could climb trees, anyway,” said Warren. “And I\\r\\nfell down. I should think you’d be sorry I fell down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry you’re silly,” said Anne, and with a look bade Jenny follow\\r\\nher downstairs. “Let him think it over a while,” she said, and Jenny\\r\\ngrinned and went out to the hens.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring was by then well on the way. Again the year had rounded through\\r\\nsleep to waking. One morning she stood at her window and watched the\\r\\nsun gild the western hills. She looked at her boy, still sleeping, one\\r\\narm thrown up over his pillow. In the next room was Jenny; she would\\r\\nhelp Warren dress, give him his breakfast. That new world out of doors\\r\\nwas calling irresistibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the road for a way, then into the pastures she went. There were\\r\\nno cattle there now; they had not yet been turned out for summer. But\\r\\nthere was other life enough; wet grass, sweet and cool; birds singing,\\r\\nrobins and bluebirds; far off, crows flying and calling. Many times\\r\\nduring the years she had gone back to that hilltop where the old maple\\r\\ngrew. No shadow there, now. Red buds on the boughs, bluets under her\\r\\nhand. As the sun rose it drew mist from the earth, smoke before an\\r\\naltar or a veil before the face of a bride. Everything softened, dark\\r\\nwoods and white birch stems, hills and fields. Those fields--year after\\r\\nyear she had watched them, dark and tired in autumn, gleaming with snow\\r\\nduring winter, in summer lying in patterns of man’s contriving. As now,\\r\\nthrough the mist, coming to life, stirring, teeming, holding within\\r\\nthemselves germs of things to come. Ordered, harmonious sequence.\\r\\nWhat was that Kent said? Harmony a thing that solves discord. That\\r\\nwas it--life, so full of discord, but nature’s on-working purpose the\\r\\nsolvent. Life ... Mrs. Bassett. That girl with the baby. Dorilliam’s\\r\\nmother, and her baby that had died, the grave that Mr. Wells tended.\\r\\nHerself and Brice. Life, something that carried them all along, through\\r\\ntheir stress, their mistakes, their sorrows and bleaknesses, as surely\\r\\nreturning, revolving, working and working and pulsing as the life under\\r\\nthose fields, the life rising now in the maple. Impelling purpose,\\r\\nthe fall of the seasons, their rise again. In the end some amalgam,\\r\\nsomething that made of the broken parts a whole. Man’s part to nature,\\r\\nand nature’s to man; interlocked service, and, later, fruition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly she went down the hill, crossed the wet fields to the house.\\r\\nShe stopped at the hen-house to investigate a nest where some chicks\\r\\nwere due to hatch that day. In the garden she stooped to release some\\r\\ndaffodils from a mass of wet leaves that were weighting them away from\\r\\nthe sun. Jenny came to the kitchen door and called, frantically waving\\r\\na dish-towel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurry up, Mis’ Denison! I got something to show yer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne went in, smiling. Warren was standing without his crutch, both\\r\\nfeet on the floor. He was holding on to the edge of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It ain’t nothing to do,” said he. “I can do it any old time, if I want\\r\\nto.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt dizzy, but she crossed the room calmly, went to the sink and\\r\\npumped a cool draft of water. “Of course you can do it,” she said.\\r\\n“Before long you will probably be walking better than you talk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“D’rilliam says ‘ain’t,’” said young Warren, grinning. “I say it, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll make you a custard for dinner,” said Anne. “Jenny, won’t you be\\r\\nlate for school?”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\nJune passed to midsummer. Corn was in tassel, here and there tobacco\\r\\nfields flaunted their tropical, broad-leaved luxuriance. Month by month\\r\\nWarren had become increasingly forgetful of his lameness. That summer\\r\\nDorilliam invented a game which gave them both infinite delight. Every\\r\\nmorning now the big team of grays would stop in front of the house and\\r\\nDorilliam would come to the kitchen door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mornin’. We’re awful short of help this year, Mis’ Denison,” he would\\r\\nsay. “We need somebody to set on the hay to keep it from fallin’ off\\r\\nthe wagon. Ain’t anybody ’round here could help us out, is there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Warren would yelp, throw himself on Dorilliam; and Anne, warned by\\r\\nthe watchful Jenny, would go to the door to wave to the helper perched\\r\\nhigh on the scented load whenever it passed the house. Her heart sang\\r\\nwhen the child would come home, his ruddy curls tousled and wet, and\\r\\nforcefully announce his hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“D’rilliam says when he’s all grown up he’s going to marry Jenny,”\\r\\nyoung Warren announced one noonday, when the last of the pudding was\\r\\ndisappearing. “He says she ain’t nearly as silly as most girls. So he’s\\r\\ngoing to marry her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny was calm, disdainful. “He thinks he’s smart,” said she. “I\\r\\nthought about us getting married long before he did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s marry, Mums?” the boy asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny replied. “It’s keeping house for a man and having a lot of\\r\\nchildren,” said she. “First you’re lovers, and then you’re married.\\r\\nSee?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s lovers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Goodness! I thought everybody knew that. Lovers are what kisses you\\r\\nwhen there ain’t anybody looking. I’m going to have lots and lots of\\r\\n’em. I wisht I wasn’t only fifteen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the sense of kissing?” Warren scoffed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny widened her eyes at him. “Plenty of sense, you silly! They go\\r\\ndown on their knees to you, too, and ask you will you be mine and all.\\r\\nThat’s when they’re lovers. After they’re husbands you cook for ’em.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bit her lip. Warren considered. “Am I a husband?”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny rolled her eyes at Anne. “Will you listen to that?” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mums cooks for me. You do, too, only I don’t like your cooking,\\r\\nmuch.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d have to like it or leave it, if you were my husband. But you\\r\\nain’t going to be. Oncet I thought maybe I’d marry a minister,” she\\r\\nwent on, dreamily. “There was one used to come to the hospital. His\\r\\nhair curled something beautiful. But I guess I’ll marry D’rilliam. In\\r\\nthe country you get the egg money, and in the city all you get is the\\r\\ncooking.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren looked at his mother solemnly. “Have you got a husband, Mums?”\\r\\nhe asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny abruptly shoved back her chair and arose. “Good-_night_,” said\\r\\nshe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed, but the question gave her thought. How soon would the\\r\\ntime come when the child would question her seriously, when she would\\r\\nhave to answer him honestly? What would the questions be, what would\\r\\nher son’s judgment be? What--and there lay the core of it all--what\\r\\nwould her own judgment be? What was it now? What had she done to\\r\\nWarren, and what had she done to Brice? Perhaps in her inmost thoughts\\r\\nshe had formulated that question before, but now it leaped out at her,\\r\\nnot to be avoided. Brice had done terrible things to her. She still\\r\\nthought that. But she had done something to Brice, too, and judgment\\r\\narose before her, not with any traditional flaming sword, but with all\\r\\nsorts of little things surrounding it--her withdrawals, his dumbly\\r\\nsubmerged disappointments, daily hurts, small daily betrayals of their\\r\\nlove. She had wanted to drive him, had used one whip and another. She\\r\\nhad ignored their stings.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was walking along a shady road one afternoon, dressed in a faded\\r\\ngingham that had been one of her new gowns the year Brice went away.\\r\\nAgain walking had become her refuge and respite, as in the months\\r\\nbefore Warren’s birth. Heathville lay too far from the highway for\\r\\nhurrying motorists and the road was too rough and narrow for them; only\\r\\nnow and again did a large car spin through it, adventuring or lost.\\r\\nSuch a car was coming now, speeding over the top of the hill beyond,\\r\\ncoming down the descent in swirls of dust. Anne stepped off the road\\r\\ninto the goldenrod. The car passed. Then, to her surprise, it stopped\\r\\na few yards beyond. The driver stood up and looked back at her. It was\\r\\nRanney Copeland. From the back seat two women turned, one whom Anne did\\r\\nnot know, the other Tessie Ogden, with mocking eyes half-veiled under\\r\\nsupercilious lids.\\r\\n\\r\\nRanney came running with both hands outstretched. “Nance! My dear\\r\\ngirl,” he cried. “This is great luck. What are you doing in this\\r\\nwilderness?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook his hands, laughing. “But I live here, of course! Surely you\\r\\nknew that from Alice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh--Alice. My sweet little sister-in-law does not approve of me any\\r\\nmore than she ever did. I’ve asked about you, my dear, many’s the time,\\r\\nand got snubbed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the car. Tessie leaned over its side. “Nance, how\\r\\nwonderful to meet you! I told Ranney this road must lead somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRanney’s wife leaned back in a corner, a thin woman, controlled,\\r\\ndissatisfied, already obviously grasping at every aid to her fading\\r\\nbeauty. She smiled very faintly when Anne was introduced. The smile\\r\\nremained on her lips. How did Anne sense the antagonism between her and\\r\\nTessie?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am on my way to the Whitmores’ camp,” Tessie explained, “and of\\r\\ncourse dear Ranney insisted on taking me. We thought this would be a\\r\\nshort cut.” She was looking at Anne’s dress, at the dust on her shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the car sped away. Anne knew as well as though she had heard\\r\\nit what Tessie’s comment would be. “Poor dear Nance! What a fright she\\r\\nis! How she has aged!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat supercilious woman in the corner, rouged and whitened, with\\r\\nover-attended eyebrows; Ranney and Tessie--those were the sort of\\r\\npeople for whom she had failed Brice, forced him and herself out of\\r\\nstep. “God knows, I don’t want to stand in your way.” That was what\\r\\nBrice had thought he was doing: setting her free for that. Into what\\r\\nfreedom had he gone?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was again alive to her as he had been during their ten years\\r\\ntogether; more alive, indeed, than he ever had been. During those years\\r\\nshe had ignored any possibility that there might be hidden places,\\r\\nsecret places, in Brice; now almost with panic she began to think about\\r\\nthem, for she had never believed he was dead. What had Brice become\\r\\nduring the years, what had he found or lost? And before that, before he\\r\\nleft, how much had he ignored and put up with? How much had he, whom\\r\\nshe had never suspected of being able to analyze at all, pondered upon\\r\\nher, tried to dissect and disconnect what he wanted her to be and what\\r\\nshe was? To what extent had he weighed and forgiven, forborne? Had\\r\\nthe ultimate revelation been as abrupt for him as his decision was to\\r\\nherself? Here, at last, with a completeness that had all the effect of\\r\\nsuddenness, like the opening of a door one has been furtively watching,\\r\\nhere was a new Brice; the same, but new. The one she had been married\\r\\nto for ten years, the one she had not seen for more than six, abruptly\\r\\nand forcefully making her think about him, estimate him, judge him and\\r\\njudge herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaughingly she related to Kent her roadside encounter with Ranney\\r\\nCopeland and Tessie. He was lounging against the back of the arbor\\r\\nin his garden, pipe in mouth, hugging his elbows. Something of her\\r\\nold gayety returned for the moment. She gave him a pantomime of Mrs.\\r\\nCopeland, mimicked the intonations of the others. His mouth quirked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the playful mood left her. “And those, my good friend, people like\\r\\nthose are what I smashed up my marriage for.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at her, for a moment saying nothing. Never before had she\\r\\nspoken of any past back of Heathville.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We-ll, I doubt if we’re really as much influenced by people as we’d\\r\\nlike to think. We all want to pass the buck. And we do smash things,\\r\\ndon’t we?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did. My husband left me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKent leaned forward, knocked the ashes from his pipe. “I supposed he\\r\\nwas dead,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is not dead. I don’t know where he is. But I know he is not dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Kent apparently found nothing to say. He did not look at Anne,\\r\\nbut off into the woods. “What little pebbles we are,” he said after a\\r\\nwhile, “and what big circles we do make.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne drew a quick breath. She got to her feet, walked a little away,\\r\\ncame back, stood with her hands behind her. “I didn’t think I was only\\r\\na little pebble. I thought I was always right. I wanted to go my own\\r\\nway, and I wanted my husband to go along with me. I stumbled. Not very\\r\\nfar. I know now that I blundered and hurt. I did not transgress any\\r\\ngreat moral law. But the circles were big, yes! We got drowned in\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder,” said Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know what you think! Perhaps it’s true. Perhaps I’m not drowned.\\r\\nIn a sense. But I have been submerged.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave her a quiet look. “Pretty well out now, though, aren’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you say that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But aren’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’ve by no means rescued myself. I’ve learned something, I\\r\\nsuppose. But why does one have to learn? I told you I broke no great\\r\\nlaws. Yet I shattered my life and Brice’s--my husband’s. And now\\r\\nthere’s Warren involved in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Um,” he muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are such blind blunderers. I’ve watched these people around here.\\r\\nThey are blind, too, most of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So are moles. But they get along.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By burrowing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat silent for a time. Kent said, musingly: “One doesn’t get\\r\\nanywhere, talking of size or degree in moral law. Nor in denying it.\\r\\nThe very act of denying admits its existence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I just never thought about it,” Anne said. “So my husband is\\r\\nsomewhere, and my son is growing up. There’s no answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way home that afternoon she took a by-road that led past a new\\r\\nhouse. She had been there before. Floyd Travers had taken the girl\\r\\nElsie there before it was finished, and even now, as she drew near, she\\r\\nheard the sharp cracking of hammer on nails. The little drama of the\\r\\nchild-mother and the young man had interested her. She had made friends\\r\\nof them both. The young man was shingling the roof of the shed; he\\r\\nwaved when he saw her, and got down from the ladder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now, Elsie will be mighty sorry she’s missed you,” he said. “She\\r\\ndrove down to get a mail-order package. I wanted to finish that roof.\\r\\nCan’t work on it till after I get home, you know, and the days are\\r\\ngetting shorter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ought not to stop you,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked off to the west. “It won’t rain tonight. I’m glad you stopped\\r\\nby, Mis’ Denison. I want to show you something.” He led her indoors.\\r\\nThe little place was shining and neat, pervaded by the smell of fresh\\r\\npaint.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that,” the lad said, opening a door. “This room’s for the\\r\\nlittle feller when he gets big enough. Elsie painted it all herself.\\r\\nThe furniture’s going to be painted, too, when we get it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne admired and praised. Floyd led the way back to the kitchen, and\\r\\nopened another door. “Elsie wanted a regular pantry,” said he. “Her ma\\r\\nnever had one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe utensils were few and cheap. There were two pies set in a screened\\r\\nwindow, and some jars of canned vegetables on an upper shelf. Anne\\r\\nlooked at the young man. He returned her look and nodded, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s a fine housekeeper, Elsie is,” he said as they went out together.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the house Anne hesitated. “Floyd, you’ve done a big thing,” she\\r\\nsaid, and knew her lips trembled a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I don’t look at it that way,” the young man returned,\\r\\nthoughtfully. “It’s sort of like this. Folks say Elsie made a mistake.\\r\\nSome of ’em say worse than that. A feller asked me once if it didn’t\\r\\nmake any difference to me. I said sure it did, because I knew we had\\r\\nsomething firm to stand on. Lots of folks get married and make their\\r\\nmistakes afterwards. I know about Elsie’s, and she knows about it. So\\r\\nwe got that to stand on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roads were still frozen. To save wood Anne sewed in the\\r\\nkitchen. That afternoon she had been looking over the past with an\\r\\ningathering sweep that merged it into a whole, set it on the scales\\r\\nof consciousness as an entity to be weighed not by the importance of\\r\\nits impulses and its mistakes, not by intention of good or evil, not\\r\\nby what gladness there was nor by the magnitude of its failures. Love,\\r\\nmarriage, her life with Brice; disaster, motherhood, toil; contact with\\r\\ncourage and misery, and with dumb striving--those set on one side of\\r\\nthe scale, and something on the other side that kept the balance even.\\r\\nWere there nothing in life to counterbalance life the scale had gone\\r\\ndown long since, and humanity with it. Here and there, now and again,\\r\\nshe had glimpsed what there was; but still there remained a sense of\\r\\nincompletion. To be and not to do was not enough, nor to envision and\\r\\nnot to strive. Yet what action lay within her control, within reach of\\r\\nher initiative? On and on; but where? Why?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone was at her door. Not one of the neighbors--some stranger, since\\r\\nthe knock came from the front of the house. She put down her sewing,\\r\\nwent through the cold, narrow hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alice--you! Over these roads!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I hadn’t seen you for nearly three years, Anne. I couldn’t wait\\r\\nany longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll have to come back to the kitchen. Alice, you dear, such a long\\r\\nway to come----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“George had business in Springfield. I’ve got to get back there\\r\\ntonight. No, the car’s heated. The man can wait outside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tea--in a minute----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Anne, I did want to see you! Ranney said you were looking so--”\\r\\nShe stopped, and Anne laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, of course! Ranney! I have seen Ranney, and Mrs. Ranney, and\\r\\nsweet Tessie!” Alice’s face had flushed slightly, and her eyes looked\\r\\ntroubled and shy, but Anne’s twinkled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alice, you silly. Don’t you suppose I know perfectly well the sort of\\r\\nthing Ranney said, and Tessie? I can hear her saying it: ‘Poor dear\\r\\nNance! How she’s aged! And what a fright she is!’ Wasn’t that it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Something like that,” Alice confessed. Then she added, “Nance, don’t\\r\\nyou care any more?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About being a fright? I’m too busy to bother. I suppose I should, if I\\r\\nstopped to think about it. I know I should.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I rather meant--about what they say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that! That’s only funny.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know, Anne, you really have changed,” Alice said after a while.\\r\\n“And I don’t mean in looks only.” Anne laughed. “You always did laugh\\r\\nat me, so you haven’t changed in that. But you seem to see things\\r\\ndifferently. You’re not the same woman, not a bit like the girl you\\r\\nwere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am the same, though. I should feel pretty hopeless, if I thought\\r\\npeople could stop being themselves, and begin over again. I’d rather\\r\\nknow that something had been added. Even something taken away. I’d\\r\\nrather stand on my past, even such as it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean not to have learned, to have----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not to find, yes. Or keep on hoping to find, anyway.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice leaned forward, her hands dropped beyond her knees. “Dear old\\r\\ngirl, if you’re still the same Nance I’m afraid I shall not dare to\\r\\ntell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer heart seemed to stand still. Something clicked in her throat. She\\r\\ncould not ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice nodded. “Yes. We have heard from him. George has seen him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stood up. She must have air--something. The clock on the mantel\\r\\nticked. The kettle hummed on the stove.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne dear----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock. The stove. There was a yellowed place on the wall-paper.\\r\\nBrice. The yellowed place was shaped like an animal. Brice.... Her\\r\\ncheeks were cold. Oh, it was her hands on them. Earth rising up. No,\\r\\nonly the floor. Far off, coming along the road, children’s voices. Oh,\\r\\nyes, from school. Supper after a while. Once there were stars ... a\\r\\npool. “I will not contest.” Shaped like an animal. Funny. What happened\\r\\nwhen....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne, dearest girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved away from Alice’s touch. Presently she sat down again. “Tell\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A letter came. Through a lawyer. To Ranney’s office.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, Brice had been thinking all this time that you and Ranney\\r\\nwere----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait. Alice, I can’t----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all right, dear, all right. We understood. Ranney gave George the\\r\\nletter. Brice has a good business, lumber. He needed some money. There\\r\\nwas a paid-up insurance policy in your name. He thought you would be\\r\\nwilling----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We talked it over. We wanted to do what was right. Ambrose came out.\\r\\nGeorge went to the lawyer, found out where Brice was. They both went\\r\\nto see him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They told him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That there had never been anything between you and Ranney.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did he believe?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They both told him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing else, Anne.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not about--Warren?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t he--ask anything?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid not, dear. But still, you know,” she went on eagerly, after\\r\\na moment, “just what they did tell him must have given him a good deal\\r\\nof a moment. And Brice never did talk much, did he?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne shook her head. No. Brice never did talk much. “But not to tell!\\r\\nHow could they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wanted them to. But I suppose things have to come out as they will.\\r\\nBrice knows now that you are living, and still his wife. And now you\\r\\nknow that Brice is living.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Anne asked, “Where?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice’s manner changed: that was over. “Oh, George says it’s lovely\\r\\ncountry, a place way up in the hills, called Pelham. It’s somewhere at\\r\\nthe end of never. Awful roads, but the land’s cheap. Brice has a mill,\\r\\nand several little tractor outfits that travel about and cut lumber. He\\r\\nwanted to buy more land.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there, at last, out of the darkness, was Brice. No longer merely\\r\\nthe man she had loved and married and shared life with for ten years.\\r\\nNo longer only that man she had thought she could whip or cajole or\\r\\ndominate, nor the man who had deserted her. Life had been sweeping her\\r\\non, doing things to her. There had been years to be lived through for\\r\\nBrice, too. What had they done to him? What were his thoughts of her\\r\\nnow? Anger? Indifference? Distaste? She had admitted to herself long\\r\\nsince that she had never seen into his secret heart, never shared nor\\r\\ndivined his mental processes. Then what was he now? A stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good business, Alice had said, in Pelham. She remembered Pelham,\\r\\nthe little close room where they slept for those first two weeks, the\\r\\nprecipitous hills, the pool, the stars. Why had he gone to Pelham? What\\r\\nhad he thought to find there, to recapture? “A good business.” Then he,\\r\\ntoo, had been carried along by life, by the details and ingredients\\r\\nof living. But he had had his denials. Different from hers. She had\\r\\nWarren. What compensations had Brice found, what strength?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon she was out of doors, contemplating her garden. The earth\\r\\nhad not dried enough for plowing, but already the sun had brought to\\r\\ngreen life small creeping weeds, nature’s hurrying way of covering\\r\\nscars and bare places. Someone had given Warren some duck’s eggs. Now\\r\\na frantic hen was trying to teach the strange yellow creatures to\\r\\nscratch. She watched them, smiling a little: even a hen’s hopes and\\r\\nplans.... Then she raised her head and listened. That was Warren’s\\r\\nvoice, shrieking, howling. She took a quick step or two towards the\\r\\nvoice, then stood still, biting her lip. He hated a fuss made over him.\\r\\nShe would wait. Then she saw them coming over the field, Warren ahead,\\r\\nJenny racing madly after him, calling. Anne’s lips felt cold, but she\\r\\nwaited and watched. Warren was wild with fury. The sound told that. But\\r\\nhe was running. Not limping, but running, tearing headlong towards home\\r\\nlike any small boy in a rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bees, Mis’ Denison,” Jenny’s call reached her. “He got in a bees’\\r\\nnest. Bees got him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe heard, and did not hear. He was pelting towards her, crimson of\\r\\nface, furious, howling. At last he threw himself against her, but when\\r\\nshe stooped to embrace him he fought her away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get ’em off o’ me. Go ’way. Le’ me go. Get ’em off o’ me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny came panting. “Gosh! There ain’t anything the matter with his\\r\\nlegs any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne knelt on the ground, tried to hold the child. “Warren, keep still!\\r\\nStop fighting me. How can I get the bees off if you won’t let me touch\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There ain’t any bees on him, Mis’ Denison. He ran away from ’em.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are, too,” Warren cried, glaring at Jenny through tears. “They\\r\\nhurt. You get ’em off o’ me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had captured his hands. “The bees are gone, Warren. There aren’t\\r\\nany on you. But do you know what you’ve done? Stop crying--look at me!\\r\\nYou’ve run away from the bees!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll say he did!” Jenny affirmed, grinning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t care!” The boy still blazed. “You get the hurts off o’ me,\\r\\nthen!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne led him into the house. “Soda’s what you put on ’em,” said Jenny\\r\\nthe experienced. So with soda they anointed him. Presently he was\\r\\ncounting the daubs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t think much of bees,” said he thoughtfully. “Drat their old\\r\\nhides. I want my supper.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night in her bedroom Anne stood by the window. No moon; but\\r\\nstars were out in cool myriads. Their light fell on the earth like a\\r\\ncaressing hand reached out in sleep. A line came into her mind, “The\\r\\narmy of unconquerable law”.... That was it. Unconquerable law. Ageless,\\r\\nuntroubled serenity. Submission, no breaking of ranks. No beating\\r\\nagainst things as they were. Safe inside of restraint. Freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distant world, a gleaming planet, dropped beyond a hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter much searching of road-maps and timetables, tables, she\\r\\ndiscovered that Pelham was distant only a long day’s drive. Dorilliam,\\r\\nnow a tall youth of nineteen, had bought the doctor’s old car and\\r\\nwould take them. Her one problem that seemed unsurmountable was the\\r\\ndisposal of Jenny. The child had become dear to her. She could not set\\r\\nher adrift on the sea of chance, subject her to the uncertain tides of\\r\\ncharity, yet she could not take her where she was going.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained a little to Dorilliam’s mother. Mrs. Wells would know\\r\\nwhat to say to the others. The neighbors came for farewell visits,\\r\\neven those she knew best wearing an unaccustomed formality that she\\r\\nunderstood. It was their tribute to the unusual, the unexpected. None\\r\\nquestioned her. Mrs. Ware, whose house was already fuller of children\\r\\nthan any other, said to her, “You let Jenny come stay with us. There’s\\r\\nplenty of room. The twins’d love having her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet in the end the problem was solved by means of Miss Abby. “Well,”\\r\\nshe sighed, as she stood up to leave, “you had a nice home here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was inspired. “Miss Abby, would you be able to come here and live\\r\\nhere with Jenny? I should be so delighted to give you the place free. I\\r\\ncouldn’t offer much else; but there’s four dollars a week for Jenny’s\\r\\nboard, and----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Land,” said Miss Abby, “I never saw that much money a week in my life.\\r\\nIt wouldn’t cost that to live, not with the garden. I guess maybe my\\r\\nbrother’d let me have wood.” She gave Anne a quick look. “I never had a\\r\\nhouse of my own.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was arranged. Jenny’s comment was, “Gee, us’ll be two old maids\\r\\ntogether.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s old maids?” Warren asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s ladies that don’t get married.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren stared at her. “Aren’t you going to marry Dorilliam?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jenny’s self-consciousness had grown in a year. “Oh--Dorilliam!\\r\\nHe’s not so much!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Dorilliam ought to get married. Mr. Ware says a farmer does\\r\\nbetter when he’s married. He could marry Miss Abby. I’ll tell him. I\\r\\nlike her, myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny rolled her eyes at Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were things to be done. She began to take count of her\\r\\nappearance. She did not want to appear before Brice in the guise of\\r\\npoverty. She wanted to make no appeal of any sort to him. Long ago\\r\\nGeorge Copeland had re-invested for her what was left of the four\\r\\nthousand dollars after Ranney’s venture with it; she had used some of\\r\\nit at the time of Warren’s illness. Each month a check brought her the\\r\\nminute income. Now the roof needed mending; that would have to be done\\r\\nbefore she left. She wrote to Alice, asking that George should in\\r\\nsome way place part of her little capital at her disposal; Warren must\\r\\nbe properly clothed, and would Alice choose a ready-made suit and a\\r\\nblouse? She made herself two new house-dresses, mended, contrived, got\\r\\nJenny ready for summer. Dorilliam plowed the garden, Anne planted it.\\r\\nThrough everything she moved deliberately, for she knew now what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last days rain came down steadily. “It won’t matter. The doctor\\r\\ngoes everywhere in the rain,” she told Dorilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re a brave woman, Anne,” Kent said, standing in her little parlor\\r\\nthe evening before she left.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him meditatively. “I don’t think it’s that, Rufus,” she\\r\\nsaid, slowly. “It’s the next thing to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How you do take it,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. “It’s taking me. Life does.” After a while she\\r\\nsaid, “I wonder why the enlightening word in all our crises comes from\\r\\noutside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have to be guide-posts, I suppose. So many paths.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. And mercifully they are really paths. Worn. Trodden.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned and looked down on her. “Was that your enlightening word?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, something on Sunday. One of the prophets, I think. ‘This day I am\\r\\ngoing the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in\\r\\nall your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all which the Lord\\r\\nyour God spake concerning you: all are come to pass.’ It leaped at me\\r\\nout of the reading. Experience--we always think our own is unique. But\\r\\nthe path has been trodden.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe slowly nodded, staring at nothing; then abruptly he threw his head\\r\\nback. “Only--dear God!--sometimes----”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood up, laid a hand on his shoulder. “Courage, Rufus,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took her hand, gripped it. “Thanks, Anne,” he said after a moment.\\r\\n“That’s your enlightening word to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey embarked in Dorilliam’s car the next morning. The rain continued,\\r\\ntrickled in rivulets around the curtains. From the front seat Warren\\r\\nchattered ceaselessly with Dorilliam. It was mid-afternoon when a\\r\\nlong descent brought them out on a road where a battered sign-post\\r\\npointed the way to Pelham. At last the hills closed in; the stream ran\\r\\ntorrential below the road. At last a bridge, a cross-road, a jam of\\r\\nlogs and a mill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah, he lives up there in the last house. Ain’t here today, though.\\r\\nDon’t know whether he’ll get back tonight or not,” someone said to\\r\\nAnne’s question.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the car into the rain. No answer to their knock on the door.\\r\\nTheir things carried into a shanty of a room or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t seem right to leave you like this,” Dorilliam said, “But I got\\r\\nto get home by morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the place Warren looked about him. “You said we were going\\r\\nsomewhere, Mums. This don’t look much like somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not answer. She too was looking around. This room they were\\r\\nin--its walls were of board with maps and blue-prints here and there,\\r\\nand flamboyant calendars, some of them three years old. A big iron\\r\\nstove, round, its rusty sides corrugated, the fire dead. A few wooden\\r\\narm-chairs and a table. A cheap morris chair, its cushions sagged to\\r\\nthe left. Her hand went to her throat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing that for? I don’t like this place. I want to go\\r\\nhome.” Warren was frowning. His lip trembled a little after he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crossed the floor to a door that stood ajar. An oil-stove there, a\\r\\ntable covered with oilcloth, an open cupboard with shelves, some dishes\\r\\nand canned things. The place was neat. A third room opened off from the\\r\\nlarge one. There too was neatness, the bed made, gray blankets pulled\\r\\nup. She remembered something. Cozy--Brice’s word--cozy....\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to go home,” said Warren. “I’m hungry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened the remnant of the lunch she had brought. “How long are we\\r\\ngoing to stay here, anyway?” Warren asked when he had eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” she said shortly. Even the muscles of her arms were\\r\\nbraced against the boy’s chatter, against that ceaseless downpour of\\r\\nrain. The room was becoming shadowy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone was whistling tunelessly. The sound penetrated the patter,\\r\\ncame on. There was a step on the porch. The door opened. Warren went\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hello!” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man in oilskins stopped abruptly, then smiled with that slight\\r\\nsoftening about the eyes of the man who loves children. “Why, hello,\\r\\nBill! What are you doing in here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren laughed, went nearer, looked up. “What makes you think my name’s\\r\\nBill? I don’t know you. Do you live here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the child’s head Brice saw Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked again at the boy. He flushed slowly, as though it were\\r\\npainfully. Even in that fading light she saw a vein stand out on his\\r\\ntemple.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it?” he asked. “Is your name Bill?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren thrust his hands into his trouser’s-pockets. “Well, not ezackly,\\r\\nyou know. It’s Warren Denison, ’s a matter of fact. But I like Bill\\r\\nbetter.” Man and boy, they stared at each other. “My mother’s name is\\r\\nMrs. Denison,” Warren further elucidated. “What’s yours?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the man looked over the child’s head at Anne. She shook her head.\\r\\nHer voice sounded strange. “Nothing. It seemed--fairer.” Her hands were\\r\\ncold. She felt stiff, rigid and stiff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Brice asked: “How did you happen to come here, Bill?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, in Dorilliam’s car. He paid a hundred and fifteen dollars for\\r\\nthat car, cash. It’s a pretty good car.” The man said nothing. Warren\\r\\nshuffled his feet. “But I don’t like this place much. Mums said we\\r\\nwere going somewhere. Is this somewhere? Why don’t you say something?\\r\\nIs this somewhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the man did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you say your name was?” asked Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Denison, too----”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren laughed. “Sort of funny! You might get mixed up with me. What’ll\\r\\nI call you? Where’s the rest of your folks?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAbruptly the man’s control broke. He raised his hands. “Oh my God!” he\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned, went blindly into the frame of the door, rebounded,\\r\\nblundered out into the rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the rain had stopped. “Well, I guess I’ll go take a\\r\\nwalk,” Warren said, in Dorilliam’s best manner. “You can come along,\\r\\ntoo, if you want to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I’ll stay here,” Anne said lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the morning a boy came up the hill with a basket. “The boss sent\\r\\nit,” he said. “If there’s anything else you want I’m to bring it up\\r\\nfrom the store. I’ll bring the milk in the evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon Warren came home, his eyes gleaming. “Say, I met that feller\\r\\nagain. I like him. He asked me to dinner, but I told him my mother’d be\\r\\nexpecting me back. Gosh, I’m hungry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been over the mill with Brice; he gave her details. “The next\\r\\ntime he invites you to stay with him, you may,” she told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three days after that she had dinner alone. She did not leave the\\r\\nhouse. She had a sense of things impending. The utmost she could do was\\r\\nto wait and to appear as usual to Warren. On the fifth evening after\\r\\nthe boy was asleep she was sitting beside the kerosene lamp, her hands\\r\\nin her lap. She did not hear his step on the porch. The knock at the\\r\\ndoor made her raise her head, but she could not get up. He came in, met\\r\\nher eyes. Then his glance took in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is in there,” she said, “asleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the floor. She knew that he stood in the doorway looking\\r\\ninto that other room. After a while he came back, sat down in the chair\\r\\nthat sagged to his shape. Presently he asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I brought Wanny.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed shortly. “After these years!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded. “He was born at the end of that year!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pause he asked, “Did you know--before?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it why you didn’t--” he swallowed,--“Copeland----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. I said that because I wanted to hurt you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat in silence for a time that seemed interminable. She thought\\r\\nthe silence would never break.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see that it’s going to do either of us any good to hark back,”\\r\\nhe said at last. “What do you propose to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not proposing anything. I brought your son.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“After these years. God----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crowded back words that were on her lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you say it?” he flung at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head moved. “It’s there between us, anyway. But even if I had known\\r\\nat first where you were, I would not have brought him. Not then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you tell me that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am ready to tell you anything. Or do anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat frowning, puzzled, suspicious, resentful. “You don’t mean that.\\r\\nYou’re working something again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clasped her hands tighter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Words, words! Something you mean to get! What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you after? What do you intend to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever is right. I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! Would you give me the boy?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer head went back. “If that is right.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed again in that way that was not mirthful. “Who’s to decide\\r\\nthat? What are you up to?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat very still. He looked at her curiously. No flare-up of anger. A\\r\\nwoman controlled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean by right?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not what we need, either of us. It’s what he needs. He’s growing\\r\\nup. That’s as far as I see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not look at each other. Presently she knew that he had taken\\r\\nthe attitude she remembered, leaning forward, his hands dropped between\\r\\nhis knees, looking intently at nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t live in this place,” he said at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not look up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are no comforts. Nothing you have been used to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I went to old Willy. Warren was born there. I’ve learned to do things.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while he crossed the floor again and went into the room where\\r\\nWarren slept. When he came back he hesitated a moment, then went out,\\r\\nwithout speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the days the intermittent whine of the saw-mill reached her.\\r\\nDuring the evenings she sat alone. She put no restraint upon Warren;\\r\\nhis air of importance grew enormously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got to hurry,” he said one morning. “We’re putting on a new belt\\r\\ntoday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe described the workings of the machinery, told how the logs came\\r\\ndown the river, called various men by name. For a time he did not come\\r\\nhome for the mid-day meal; he regaled her at supper with boastful\\r\\ntales of wondrous food he had had, things hitherto forbidden him,\\r\\npies, corned-beef, dumplings. When she refrained from the comment he\\r\\nevidently expected he eyed her speculatively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t cook things like that,” he said. “I like that man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one noon he appeared, frowning. He threw his cap across the floor.\\r\\n“He made me come home,” he told her. “He says I can stay tomorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few days she understood. Brice was sharing him. As her first\\r\\ndread wore off she accepted it. There was nothing to do but live in\\r\\nthe moment; the moments hung heavily. She could not plan, and she\\r\\nwould not think. There was little to do in the shack. She explored the\\r\\nwoods, walked up the road past the house where she and Brice had once\\r\\nstayed. Polish people lived there now. When she had been there a week\\r\\nor two she went to the store. From a distance she saw them together,\\r\\nfather and son. They were standing on the boxed runway beside the dam,\\r\\nidentical in posture, their heads identical in tilt and color.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne or two women in the store eyed her curiously and slipped out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good morning, Mrs. Denison,” the store-keeper said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she was known. Yet she expected that, knew what surmises and\\r\\ncomments must be going about. She took home some yarn, some packets of\\r\\nseeds. The cabin had been built over the cellar-hole of a house long\\r\\nsince burned; at the back was a weedy place where a garden had once\\r\\nbeen. She grubbed up the dried stuff, went to the nearest house to\\r\\nborrow a spade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You come here to stay?” the woman asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Long enough to make a garden, anyway,” Anne replied, smiling. “Long\\r\\nenough to get acquainted with folks, too, I hope.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’ll be nice for Mr. Denison. The little feller does favor his\\r\\npa.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish you’d leave your baby with me, sometime,” Anne returned, and\\r\\nthe relationship was established.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Run over again,” said the woman, and Anne returned, “You, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spaded and planted. It was good to be at work, again, normal work,\\r\\naccustomed work. One morning a few weeks later she was there on her\\r\\nknees grubbing out the first weeds when she heard Warren calling. He\\r\\ncame around the house, Brice with him. The man stood still as Anne rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re going off to one of the camps,” said Wanny. “Can we?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne brushed the hair out of her eyes, looked at Brice. But he was\\r\\nfrowning at the garden. “Who did that?” he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not done yet. Rather weedy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I always have a garden.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I help,” Warren put in. “Though of course this year I’ve been\\r\\nrather busy. Say, Mums, can we? Can we go?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked inquiringly at Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be late when we get back,” he said. “I didn’t like to take him\\r\\nwithout asking you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe brushed the earth from her hands. “Just wait a minute. I’ll put up\\r\\na lunch,” she said, and walked off into the house. From the kitchen she\\r\\nheard Warren’s crescendo of questions, finally his “What’s the matter\\r\\nwith you, Dad? Why don’t you answer? Say, Dad, why don’t you answer?” A\\r\\nglance showed her Brice staring at the bit of raw land....\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had gone she went thoughtfully back to her weeding. Weeds,\\r\\nlittle things that crept in overnight, things that grew so swiftly.\\r\\nSome might go on to blossom, all would drop seed if let grow. And they\\r\\nwere not wanted; they got in the way of human intention, interfered\\r\\nwith human endeavor. Yet nature loved them. Even in a garden they had\\r\\ntheir uses. If one pulled them out, their roots loosened the soil about\\r\\nworthier plants. What weeds were there now between her and Brice? She\\r\\ndid not know. Old things between them. She knew that, knew that he\\r\\nstill resented them. She had known that he must, even before their one\\r\\ninterview. Was he letting those die now, wilt in the sun of Warren?\\r\\nShe did not know. And she must not think. Things went on, carried one\\r\\nwith them. That was all she could do now. Wait, let herself be carried\\r\\nalong. There had been many times when she would have doubted the\\r\\ncurrent. She was doing all she could to yield herself to it. Now she\\r\\ndid not so much as know what she wanted. To want was not vital. The\\r\\nonly thing was to go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was midnight when they came home. She heard them, opened the door,\\r\\nholding the lamp high. Warren was blinking as though he had just\\r\\nawakened. Anne laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d better get him to bed,” she said. She set the lamp on the table,\\r\\nwent off to the kitchen. She did not return until she heard the door\\r\\nclose behind Brice, half an hour later. He had not spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually she made friends with more of the women. For the most part\\r\\nthey were not like the old neighbors, being of alien birth or else\\r\\nof that class that drifts from place to place as their men grow\\r\\ndissatisfied with one job and seek out another. There was no church,\\r\\nthe school-house was closed. The woman from whom she borrowed the spade\\r\\nhad her fifth baby that summer, the last one just creeping, the oldest\\r\\na boy of seven. Anne saw the doctor’s car there in the morning, went\\r\\nover and helped. The woman was tired; the case prolonged itself. It was\\r\\nWanny’s day to be home for dinner, but she could not leave. She trusted\\r\\nto the child’s returning to Brice, and that night Brice came up the\\r\\nhill with him at supper time. The day had been hot and wearying. She\\r\\nwas sitting on the unpainted steps of the porch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bill said you weren’t here,” Brice said. “Anything wrong?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. The Cadigan baby came. I was down there helping.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave her a sharp look, nodded, turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week or two later he stood in the door with Warren tugging at his\\r\\nhand. “C’m’on in! Say, Mums, I asked him to supper. He said he liked\\r\\nradishes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked in from the kitchen. “Of course,” she said. “I’ll put on\\r\\nanother plate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, sit down,” she said a while later. “Don’t wait for me. I’ll\\r\\nbring in the things.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice was not looking at her. He was awkward, silent. When Warren\\r\\noffered him the radishes he flushed. “We grow them pretty good, don’t\\r\\nwe?” asked Warren, complacently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Biscuits?” Anne hurriedly suggested. “Here’s your coffee, Brice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren stared at her. “What did you call him that for?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed. “That’s his name,” she informed him. “Why not?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren looked at the man for confirmation. “Is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice grinned. “It is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren’s eyes were round. “How did you know, Mums? Did you know him\\r\\nbefore we came here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course. Years before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you know he was my father?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice’s hands dropped in his lap. He stared at his son, gave a brief\\r\\nglance at Anne, stared again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I knew that, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then all I got to say is I think you were awful slow about handing\\r\\nhim over,” said Warren. “But anyway, I’m glad I got him now. My father\\r\\ncould wollop Johnny Ware’s father. He could beat up most anybody, I\\r\\nguess.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks,” said Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren eyed him over a glass of milk. “But there’s one thing about\\r\\nfathers I don’t like very much,” said he. “I might as well tell you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shoot,” said Brice, his lips twitching.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well. Johnny Ware’s father gave him a licking once when he hadn’t done\\r\\na single thing but just lied a little bit, and I don’t think I’d like\\r\\nto get----”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice pushed his chair back, leaned across the table towards his son,\\r\\nshaking a finger. “Now look here,” said he, “you may like it or not. If\\r\\nI ever catch you lying, friend Bill, what Johnny Ware’s father did to\\r\\nhim won’t be a patch on what you will get. Understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren frowned and flushed. His eyes were on Brice’s. “Yes,” he said\\r\\nafter a moment, in a weaker tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say ‘Yes, sir!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir,” Warren meekly repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, her hands full of dishes, went hastily out of the room. As\\r\\nshe passed back and forth she caught bits of their talk. Brice was\\r\\nstanding, filling his pipe, smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought not to be doing this,” he said to her abruptly. She stood\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This?” she asked, honestly wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This work. I saw washing on a line. That garden.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, work’s good for everybody. Besides, I honestly like it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she seated herself by the lamp and took up her knitting.\\r\\n“Bedtime, young man,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not going to bed just yet,” the young man informed her. “You see,\\r\\nI’ve got company.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do as your mother tells you,” from Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child looked from one to the other. “Will you come tell me a story\\r\\nafter I get in bed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. You don’t get rewarded for what you ought to do. Off with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the door closed behind the boy he knocked the ashes from his pipe\\r\\nand put it into his pocket. He was standing beyond the table. “I don’t\\r\\nget you, Anne,” he said. She looked up from her knitting. “This work.\\r\\nYou can’t stay on here. There are no other women.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not lonely, if that’s what you mean. And there are other women.\\r\\nI’ve been making their acquaintance.” His head moved impatiently. “I\\r\\nmean of your own sort. Naturally.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are women who have lived. I have, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You, digging in a garden, washing dishes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed. “You ought to have seen my first garden, Brice. I weeded\\r\\nup all the beets.” She changed needles. She knew that he was looking\\r\\ndown at her. He took a turn across the room and back, lighted a pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you trying to do?” he asked at last. “You’re trying to put\\r\\nover something.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer knitting dropped in her lap. “I am not trying to put anything over.\\r\\nI’m not trying to do anything. But I don’t blame you for thinking it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, blame!” He threw himself into the big chair, leaning forward,\\r\\nelbows on knees, staring off. Presently he said, “I was a beast, Anne,\\r\\nto light out as I did. That was a scoundrelly trick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old Willy said once that people are always getting mixed up about sins\\r\\nand mistakes. We are, aren’t we?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laughed shortly. “One’s an easier word to say than the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. But I think we were guilty of both, really.” She spoke slowly,\\r\\nthinking it out. “Sin isn’t only transgressing the law.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I did transgress the law. Even seeing it as a mere contract, I\\r\\ndidn’t stand up to my job.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. “It went deeper than that, Brice. Ours was a\\r\\nspiritual sin. Neither of us saw that we were transgressing an ideal.\\r\\nI didn’t even know there was one. And if I had known, I wouldn’t have\\r\\ncared.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smoked for a moment in silence. “Just what do you mean?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not clever. Perhaps I can’t make it clear. But marriage is\\r\\nsomething more than a contract. It ought to be, anyway. Life is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Life is that, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. But it’s only when we work inside of the terms of the contract,\\r\\nof life, marriage, anything, that we make anything of it. It’s only\\r\\nwhen we don’t strain at things that we’re free.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We strained at things. And they broke.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Broke. We didn’t see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“See what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh. All life is a part of life, Brice. It’s when we don’t go along\\r\\nwith it, don’t see there’s something that carries us along....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?” he asked again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated. He could scarcely hear the words. “There have been times\\r\\nwhen I have seen God.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment he said, “You weren’t religious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not speaking in terms of religion. Not thinking that way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Terms of nature, perhaps. The earth goes on--autumn and spring,\\r\\nsunlight, storms, but on and on, carried along. There are scars. Things\\r\\ncrowd into growth to cover them up. I’ve lived among farmers, bad\\r\\nseasons, good seasons. People, too--we enjoy, grow, suffer. Something\\r\\ncarries us on. There is something sustaining. Something at work through\\r\\neverything, urging us, binding us, banding us. So we go on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that what you mean by having seen God?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The force is there. And at work. Why be afraid of terms, of names?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But force. I think of force as something to use.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I, too,” she murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe filled his pipe again. “Use--God?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God, force. We do use it. Whatever’s at work sees that we do, whether\\r\\nwe know it or not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unconsciously. Haphazard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not haphazard. We don’t see the whole scheme. That does not make us\\r\\nless a part of it. Nor less important. And it can be used consciously.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I have used it consciously.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By faith.” He stirred impatiently, and she looked at him. “That word\\r\\noffends you. I mean it only as a reaching out with one’s soul, a\\r\\nwillingness to let the force that is God carry us along.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat for minutes without speaking. When at last he spoke it was in a\\r\\ndifferent tone. “I don’t know you, Anne.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there is Warren! He is our going on.” Presently she added,\\r\\nwithout looking up, “You had better look in on him before you go.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that night there was more ease between them. Frequently he came\\r\\nup with the boy to supper; then his coming became a matter of course.\\r\\nOne evening he dropped an envelope at Anne’s place. She looked at him\\r\\ninquiringly. He flushed, avoided her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Money,” he said shortly. “Thought you’d be needing it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed. “Did you ever know a woman who didn’t? Many thanks!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks--” he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe caught his embarrassment, hurried on. “But you’ve been good about\\r\\nsending up food, and there’s not much to spend money for here. I’ve\\r\\nrather fallen out of the way of spending.” She stopped abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Anne--I’ve wondered.... How did you manage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ambrose bought the house finally. And George got back the money from\\r\\nRanney.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEven now his face clouded at the name. “Where did you live?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you--in Heathville.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heathville----?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With Willy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She went away to her father,” Warren remarked. “He must be a pretty\\r\\nold man by now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s eyes gleamed at Brice. “I went there right after I found out\\r\\nabout--Wanny. Willy left me the place, and----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you find out about me?” Warren demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You eat your supper,” said Brice. “Don’t interrupt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“--and I--I think I learned how to live--there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know how to live,” said Warren. “You just breathe and breathe----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you not to interrupt!” said Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wasn’t interrupting, Dad! I was just talking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was interrupting, and you know it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well--I forgot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A gentleman does not forget things he ought to remember, young man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you a gentleman?” asked Warren, eyes as blandly innocent as a\\r\\nnewsboy’s. “Because of course if you are I’m perfectly willing to be\\r\\none, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice glanced swiftly at Anne, flushing painfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Warren,” said she, “I rather suspect that you are trying to discover\\r\\nwhether you can answer your father back. Suppose you go to your room\\r\\nand think about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t finished my supper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do as your mother tells you,” said Brice; and Warren departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other; Anne laughed deprecatingly. “He needs you,”\\r\\nshe said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he had me there. A gentleman does not forget things he ought to\\r\\nremember.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t, Brice,” she said, her hands trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that the child led them, but before the summer was gone she\\r\\nknew that her own going on was through Brice as well. Not with the old\\r\\nlove, that fragile, incomplete thing that had failed them both. Before,\\r\\nshe had been unaware of Brice’s thought unless it concerned herself\\r\\nactively, or else she had mentally shrugged it aside, or set herself\\r\\nagainst it. Of things deeper than thought, formative, unseen broodings\\r\\nof the spirit, she had been wholly ignorant. She had taken no account\\r\\nof Brice except in his outward aspects, slow-moving, slow-thinking; as\\r\\nto most things inarticulate except when she stung him or lured him to\\r\\nspeech. She had had no sensitiveness towards him; now she was becoming\\r\\nsensitive to his every look, every mood. When he watched Warren,\\r\\nshe understood why. When his lips twitched or a look of surprise or\\r\\ndeliberation was on his face, she knew what he was thinking. When after\\r\\nsome word of hers he sat silent, her thoughts followed his. He was a\\r\\nguest in the house of her mind, he who had dwelt there in such varying\\r\\nguises. New contacts, new apprehensions were revealing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Brice’s attitude towards herself, she knew that his first\\r\\ndistrust was wearing off. She knew that he watched her and wondered.\\r\\nShe knew that she had made him think. In earlier days she had wanted\\r\\nhim to think her way; now she was content, more than content, to trust\\r\\nto his thinking for himself. She respected him. He was no longer the\\r\\nstoop-shouldered, plodding commuter, either in mind or body. He had\\r\\naged more than the years could account for. He was broader, heavier\\r\\nthan the man who used to push the lawn-mower and yearn to go fishing.\\r\\nIn place of the plodding contentment of those days there was the\\r\\nalertness of active purpose about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a bleak day in May, one of those days when winter seems to return\\r\\nfor a final flaunt of his power, Warren came in to supper with\\r\\nunwonted quietness, wearing an air of complacency, his hair damp. They\\r\\nquestioned him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure,” he admitted. “I went in swimming. All the fellers went in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did I tell you?” asked Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You said not to go in ’cause the water’s cold. It wasn’t a bit cold\\r\\ntoday. So I went in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else did I tell you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else did I tell you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice’s hand came down on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” said Warren. “You said not to go in until I could swim.\\r\\nWell, I can swim now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you not to go into the water until I had taught you to swim.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren reached for a biscuit. “Maybe you did, come to think of it,” he\\r\\nadmitted. “I guess I forgot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not forget. You disobeyed. Tomorrow you will stay in your room\\r\\nall day. Your mother will take you your meals, or I will. For the whole\\r\\nday you will stay there alone. You’ll have time to make up your mind\\r\\nthat remembering pays. Understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night he was restless and feverish, but in the morning he\\r\\nappeared, dressed and smiling, ignoring the slight hoarseness in his\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this?” asked Brice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I got to go to school, I suppose. I suppose you wouldn’t want me\\r\\nto miss school.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice laid a hand on his shoulder and marched him, protesting and\\r\\nkicking, into the bedroom, took him his oatmeal and milk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t I get any toast?” asked Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You do not,” said Brice, with emphasis. “Nor sugar.” He turned the key\\r\\nin the lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon he asked, “Any sounds from up there? Any protests?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a murmur,” Anne told him. They smiled. She gave him a plate, a\\r\\nglass of milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his exclamation Anne ran in from the kitchen. The bedroom was empty,\\r\\nthe window open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun high, the sun low, night coming, then darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun high: after an hour or two the whine of the mill suddenly\\r\\nstopping. Without hat or coat Anne ran up the road. Men pouring out,\\r\\nseparating in groups, going off into the woods, up the road. A woman\\r\\ncame to Anne’s side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you worry like that, Mis’ Denison,” she said. “They’ll find him.\\r\\nHe can’t have gone far.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLater the schoolteacher, tears in her frightened eyes. “Oh, Mrs.\\r\\nDenison, I am so sorry! I thought you were keeping him home for\\r\\nsomething. I ought to have sent to find out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, her lips dry, shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t there something I can do?” the girl asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething that she could do!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun low: dusk, and from across the river came the woman whom Anne\\r\\nhad stood by in her travail. “Sure, an’ don’t ye go frettin’ yourself\\r\\nlike that, ma’am. It won’t do any good to fret.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat numbness, that quietness--fretting!\\r\\n\\r\\nNight coming: and Brice coming in for a flash-light and lanterns,\\r\\navoiding her eyes. Those lines by his mouth, the dark under his eyes.\\r\\nThe blacksmith’s wife there in the room with her, deep-bosomed, untidy,\\r\\nkind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’ll be wanting some coffee,” she told Anne. “You help me, my dear.\\r\\nThere’s nothing like work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the hill with the pail of steaming brew between them, cups handed\\r\\nout to the men who passed by, twos and threes, singly, stopping only to\\r\\nquaff down the drink, avoiding Anne’s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarkness: people there in the house, in the room, whisperings, a door\\r\\nopened upon the night. The cool night, the sweet night, night sounds\\r\\nand stars, and somewhere out there Warren, alone, perhaps stumbling,\\r\\nperhaps fallen, perhaps going on and on, losing himself over and over,\\r\\nlike those lanterns that came and went through the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards midnight the house became quieter. People had slipped away.\\r\\nOnly Mrs. Cadigan remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to go back to the children,” Anne said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure, they can do without me the night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore dawn the sound of men running. Anne rushed to the road. “Have\\r\\nthey----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not yet. But don’t you go down, ma’am. They’re getting things ready to\\r\\ndrag the mill-pond.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBlindly into the house again. Morning. Women entering quietly, as\\r\\nthough they were gathering for a.... Anne went into her bedroom, fell\\r\\non her knees. Not prayer, nothing that words could be found for.\\r\\nWeakness. Her spirit clutching at something that was not there, held by\\r\\nhuman suffering to human Weakness, faltering but reaching out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far off, at first. Sounds, all part of the horror. Part of the\\r\\nencompassing agony. Then a voice at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mis’ Denison! Quick----!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHerself in the door, women crowding about her, supporting her, laughing\\r\\nand crying. Their words with no meaning. Those sounds coming nearer.\\r\\nMen shouting and calling, waving their hats, swinging their lanterns.\\r\\nBrice in the doorway. Over his shoulder, Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s hot milk, Mis’ Denison.” That, from one of the women. Another\\r\\nwas on her knees, chafing his feet. Another came presently with a pail\\r\\nof hot water to bathe them in. The dear weight on her lap, his head on\\r\\nher shoulder, and Brice standing by, watching them both.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll come back by and by and red up a bit,” one of the women said.\\r\\nAnne smiled at them. They looked so very far off. They were shadows. In\\r\\nher arms was the substance of life. The door closed behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren’s arm went about her neck. He whimpered a little. “You were so\\r\\nmean, Mums, you and Dad. I ran away. I wanted to show you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBrice carried him to bed. He was asleep before they undressed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, facing each other, the night and the years there between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brice, did you hear what he said?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. “I was thinking--all the time there in the woods--if he\\r\\nshould be--if we didn’t find him.... You would go, too.... Oh, my God,\\r\\nAnne! I need you so!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscriber’s Note\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n • Italics represented with surrounding _underscores_.\\r\\n\\r\\n • Small caps converted to ALL CAPS.\\r\\n\\r\\n • Obvious typographic errors and omissions silently corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n • Variations in hyphenation and spelling kept as in the original.\\r\\n   Except for the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n     p. 201 “to-day” to “today”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WAY OF ALL EARTH ***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
